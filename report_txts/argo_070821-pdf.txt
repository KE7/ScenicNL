An Argo AI Autonomous Vehicle ("Argo AV") traveling northeast bound on Stanford Ave was involved in a collision. The Argo AV came
to a complete stop at the stop sign located at the intersection of Stanford Ave and Bowdoin Ave. When the Argo AV began to accelerate the
vehicle directly behind the Argo AV made contact with the Argo AV's rear bumper. The Argo AV sustained minor damage to its rear
bumper. No injuries were reported at the scene and the police were not contacted.
