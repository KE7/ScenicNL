On June 14th, a test vehicle was operating in autonomous mode when the safety driver took manual control immediately before a white
Mazda3 made contact with the rear of the test vehicle and caused damage to a sensor. This occurred as the test vehicle was making a right
turn from Moorpark Way to East Evelyn Avenue in Mountain View. The test vehicle operators believed they had run over road debris and
did not discover the crash or damage until after returning to base, so the two vehicles did not exchange information. No injuries were
reported, and law enforcement was not called to the scene.
