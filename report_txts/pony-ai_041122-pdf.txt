On April 11, 2022, while in supervised (““Drivered”) autonomous mode, a Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle was parked in a parking lot when a
passenger vehicle reversed into the Pony.ai vehicle. The Pony.ai vehicle sustained minor damage to the driver’s side rear door. There were

no injuries or other property damage, the police were not called to the scene, and the Pony.ai vehicle was driven back to Pony.ai’s Fremont
facility.
