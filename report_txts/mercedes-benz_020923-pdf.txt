The subject Mercedes-Benz vehicle was driving in stop and go traffic on the 405 south freeway in Gardena, California with the L3 ADS
activated. The test route selected by the driver in the vehicle's navigation system indicated an upcoming exit, so the driver began to prepare
for a lane change towards the highway exit by deactivating the L3 ADS and activating the turn signal. Once the vehicle was in conventional
driving mode, the driver looked for a gap in the adjacent lane to merge towards the exit lane, applied the brakes, and slowed the vehicle
down. The SUV following the Mercedes-Benz vehicle did not respond in time to the vehicle's braking and contacted the rear of the
Mercedes-Benz approximately 10 seconds after the L3 ADS was deactivated. The Mercedes-Benz vehicle experienced minor damage to the
rear bumper. No injuries were reported, no airbags deployed in either vehicle, and both vehicles were driven from the scene of the incident.
