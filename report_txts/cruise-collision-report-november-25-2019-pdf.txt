A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was making a right turn from eastbound California Street
onto southbound Hyde Street when another vehicle made contact with the Cruise AV’s rear bumper, damaging the rear fascia and the rear
center radars. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party and police were not called. Days after the collision, the Cruise AV
test operator sitting in the driver's seat reported injuries. [originally filed 12/4/2019, amended 12/16/2019]
