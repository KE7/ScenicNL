On February 28, 2022 at 12:49 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on Cesar Chavez at Mission Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped at a red light facing west on Cesar Chavez at the Mission Street intersection in the left turn lane in
autonomous mode. While the traffic light was still red, the vehicle immediately behind the Waymo AV began to accelerate toward the right
side of the Waymo AV and made contact with the right rear bumper of the Waymo AV. The other vehicle left the scene without
exchanging information. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was
present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
