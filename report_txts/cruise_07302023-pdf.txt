A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Mission Street between
Virginia Avenue and 29th Street. As the AV was yielding to oncoming traffic in preparation to make a left turn onto westbound 29th Street
on a green light, a dark-colored BMW Sedan traveling behind the AV failed to stop and rear-ended the AV, damaging the rear passenger
side bumper fascia and rear passenger side wheel molding of the AV. The driver of the dark-colored BMW Sedan left the scene without
exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
