On November 20, 2021 at 11:11 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was ina
collision involving an SUV on the 1700 block of Steiner Street.

The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode and traveling northbound on Steiner Street as it crossed the intersection at Post Street. An SUV
then turned right from Post Street onto Steiner Street and began closely following the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV test driver then took
manual control and stopped the Waymo AV. The SUV then stopped, reversed, and drove around the Waymo AV and made contact with the
Waymo AV’s driver side rear fender. At the time of the impact the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was

operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage and the SUV left the scene without exchanging
information.
