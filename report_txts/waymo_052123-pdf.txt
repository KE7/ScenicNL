On May 21, 2023 at 10:56 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (““Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a small dog on Toland Street at Toland Place.

The Waymo AV was traveling southwest on Toland Street when a small dog ran into the street in front of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV
then made contact with the dog, which did not survive. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in
autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained damage.
