A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
southbound Cayuga Street at the intersection with Geneva Street. As the Cruise AV entered the intersection on a green light and continued
southbound on Cayuga Street, a Honda Civic traveling northbound on Cayuga Street initiated an unprotected left turn in the intersection.

The Cruise AV hard braked but, shortly thereafter, the Honda Civic made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the back left bumper of the
Cruise AV. Police were not called to the scene and no injuries were reported.
