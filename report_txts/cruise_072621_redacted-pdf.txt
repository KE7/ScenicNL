A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Sth Street and yielding to
oncoming traffic before making a left turn onto westbound Howard Street. The Cruise AV was yielding to an oncoming electric scooterist
when the light turned from green to yellow. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode to make the left turn and,
shortly thereafter, the electric scooterist made contact with the right side of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV's front and rear
passenger doors. The electric scooterist reported soreness and bruising and the San Francisco police were called. It is unknown at this time
whether an investigation is being conducted by law enforcement.
