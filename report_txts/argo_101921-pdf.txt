An Argo AI Autonomous Vehicle (“Argo AV”) was involved in a rear-end collision on Grant Ave. The Argo AV came to a complete stop
at the stop sign located at the intersection of Grant Ave. and El Camino Real. After the Argo AV began to initiate a right-hand turn, the
Argo AV came to a stop in response to oncoming traffic. A vehicle trailing behind the Argo AV moved forward and contacted the Argo
AV’s left rear bumper. The Argo AV sustained minor damage to its left rear bumper.
