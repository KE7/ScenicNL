On October 19, 2021 at 12:33 PM PDT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a passenger car on California Street between Jordan Avenue and Cherry Street.

While in manual mode and stopped behind traffic waiting to make an unprotected left turn from California Street onto Cherry Street, the
Waymo AV test driver attempted to make a right lane change to proceed around its stopped lead vehicle, and made contact with a passenger
vehicle traveling in the right adjacent lane. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was
operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its front passenger side bumper corner and sensor
hardware, and the passenger vehicle sustained moderate scraping and denting on the driver’s side rear passenger door.
