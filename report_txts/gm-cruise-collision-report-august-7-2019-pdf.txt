A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on 24th Street between Noe and
Sanchez Streets when the Cruise AV yielded to a jaywalking pedestrian and for clearance to maneuver around a double-parked vehicle
immediately ahead of it. While the Cruise AV waited, another vehicle pulling out of a driveway and into the Cruise AV’s lane made contact

with the left rear corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s left rear bumper, fender, and radar. There were no injuries and police
were not called.
