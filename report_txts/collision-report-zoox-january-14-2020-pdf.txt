A Zoox vehicle in manual mode was in traffic on 5th St, south of Folsom St., when the car immediately behind it passed on the left. That
car made contact with the left-rear bumper of the Zoox vehicle, causing a minor scratch. The driver of the Zoox vehicle then pulled over to
assess damage and exchange driver information, but the other vehicle did not stop. There were no injuries, and police were not called.
