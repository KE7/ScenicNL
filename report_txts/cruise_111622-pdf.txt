A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in manual mode, was traveling northbound in the rightmost lane on Van Ness
Avenue between Eddy Street and Ellis Street. The Cruise test driver began to maneuver around a double-parked vehicle by merging left into
the center lane. Shortly thereafter, a 2013 Nissan Juke made contact with the Cruise AV's driver side rear passenger door and front driver

side fender, damaging the driver side rear passenger door, front driver side fender, front driver side radar equipment and front driver side
bumper. There were no reported injuries at the scene by either party.
