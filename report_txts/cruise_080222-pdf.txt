A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on The Embarcadero
Street between Don Chee Way and Mission Street. At the same time, a Honda Accord began to merge into the Cruise AV's lane behind the
Cruise AV. The Cruise AV braked and, shortly thereafter, the Honda Accord made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the rear driver
side bumper of the Cruise AV. The parties exchanged information and there were no reported injuries.
