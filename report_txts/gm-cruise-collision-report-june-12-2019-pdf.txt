A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling in the left lane on northbound Folsom Street
between 13th and 12th Streets when another vehicle changed into the Cruise AV’s lane without using its left signal. The driver of the Cruise
AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, the Cruise AV and the other vehicle made contact, damaging the Cruise
AV’s front right bumper, fender, and wheel well. There were no injuries and police were not called.
