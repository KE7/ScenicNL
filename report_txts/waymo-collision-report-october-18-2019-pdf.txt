A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode on the interchange from eastbound Alma Street merging
onto southbound Oregon Expressway in Palo Alto when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV was yielding to cross-traffic when a passenger
vehicle made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 8 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to the rear

bumper, and the passenger vehicle sustained minor damage to its front bumper. There were no injuries reported at the scene; the Waymo
test driver later reported dizziness but declined medical attention.
