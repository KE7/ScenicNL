On April 18, 2022 at 8:14 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on Bryant Street and Sth Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped at a red light facing northeast on Bryant Street in autonomous mode. While the light was still red, a passenger
vehicle that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV began to move forward and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time

of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating
position). The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
