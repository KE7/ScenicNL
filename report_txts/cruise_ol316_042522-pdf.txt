A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was stopped at a red light on westbound
Sacramento Street at the intersection with Van Ness Avenue. The Cruise AV began to proceed straight after the light turned green. At the
same time, a silver Hyundai Sedan was traveling the wrong way (eastbound) on a one-way section of Sacramento Street between Franklin
Street and Van Ness Avenue. The silver Hyundai Sedan entered the intersection across from the Cruise AV, and the Cruise AV came to a
full stop. The silver Hyundai Sedan continued traveling the wrong way through the intersection with Van Ness Avenue and, shortly
thereafter, made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the front fascia assembly and various components on the front of the Cruise AV.

The driver of the silver Hyundai Sedan left the scene without exchanging information. The Cruise AV was towed from the scene. There
were no injuries and a police report was later filed.
