A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in manual mode, was traveling Westbound on Fulton Street between Pierce and
Scott Streets. As the Cruise AV was proceeding straight through the intersection, contact was made to the Cruise AV’s rear bumper by a

black Honda Accord. There were no injuries but emergency services were notified via OnStar. The driver of the Honda Accord did not stop
after the incident and could not be contacted.
