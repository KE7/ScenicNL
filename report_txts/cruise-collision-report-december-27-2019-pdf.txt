A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Stanyan Street at the
intersection with Beulah Street when a lane-encroaching municipal city bus in the right adjacent lane attempted to pass the Cruise AV. The
driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, the city bus made contact with the right side of the

Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right articulating radar casing. There were no injuries. Police were called but not dispatched to the
scene.
