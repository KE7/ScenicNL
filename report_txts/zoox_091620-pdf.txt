A Zoox vehicle in autonomous mode was traveling on Folsom Street straight through the Sth Street intersection when a passenger vehicle in
the right adjacent lane attempted to make a left turn in front of the Zoox vehicle onto Sth Street. The rear left bumper of the turning
passenger vehicle made contact with the front right side of the Zoox vehicle. There were no injuries, and the police were not called.
