A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV’), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Fell Street between Webster and
Fillmore Streets when the Cruise AV began to yield to traffic in the left adjacent lane. The driver of the Cruise disengaged from autonomous
mode, and shortly thereafter, another vehicle changing into the same lane made contact with the right rear corner of the Cruise AV,
damaging the Cruise AV’s rear hatch and window and right rear body and fascia. There were no injuries and police were not called.
