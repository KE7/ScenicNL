A Cruise autonomous vehicle (â€œCruise AV), operating in autonomous mode, was yielding to oncoming traffic prior to making a left turn
onto northbound Palm Avenue from eastbound Geary Boulevard when another vehicle made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV.

There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party and police were not called. The Cruise AV tester sitting in the front passenger
seat later mentioned neck pain.
