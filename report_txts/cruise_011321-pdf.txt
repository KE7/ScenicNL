A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was traveling northbound on Grant Avenue between Sutter Street
and Post Street. A skateboard that escaped control of a nearby pedestrian made contact to the Cruise AV at the front passenger side tire.
The skateboard caused minimal damage to the front right wheel of the Cruise AV. There were no injuries and the police were not called.
