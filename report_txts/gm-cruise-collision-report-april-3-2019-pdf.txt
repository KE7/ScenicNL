Two Cruise autonomous vehicles (“Cruise AV 1” and “Cruise AV 2”), both operating in conventional mode, were stopped side-by-side at
the traffic light on southbound Potrero Avenue at the intersection with Alameda Street when a pedestrian in the crosswalk approached both
Cruise AVs in the street. The pedestrian struck both vehicles with a foreign object, scratching the front right bumper of Cruise AV 1 and
denting the front driver side door of Cruise AV 2. Both drivers of the Cruise AVs immediately drove to safer locations after the incident and

contacted the police. There were no injuries. The police later took statements from both drivers of the Cruise AVs and a report was filed as
SFPD incident report number 190236884.
