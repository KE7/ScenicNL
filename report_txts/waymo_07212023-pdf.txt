On July 21, 2023 at 9:51 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger car on Leavenworth Street at Golden Gate Avenue.

The collision occurred while the Waymo AV was stopped in the leftmost lane of a two-lane, one-way road at the intersection of
Leavenworth Street at Golden Gate Avenue. The Waymo AV was stopped before the intersection, yielding to blocking cross-traffic when
the light turned yellow. At that point, a passenger car that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left and
proceeded into the intersection. While passing the Waymo AV, the passenger car’s rear passenger side door made contact with the driver

side rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The passenger
car did not stop but appears to have sustained damage.
