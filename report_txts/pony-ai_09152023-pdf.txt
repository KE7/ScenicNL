On September 15, 2023, a Pony.ai autonomous vehicle (AV) collided with road debris while operating in supervised autonomous
("Drivered") mode northbound on the 880 freeway, preparing to enter the Dixon Landing exit.

Immediately prior to the incident, the safety driver noticed a flat item was in the center part of the lane. The driver disengaged from
autonomous mode and attempted to dodge the debris. However, the debris struck the rear bumper slightly damaging it.

Following the collision, the safety operator promptly drove the AV to Pony.ai's Fremont office. There were no injuries reported, and the
police were not called.
