An Argo AI Autonomous Vehicle (“Argo AV”) traveling southbound in manual mode on El Camino Real was involved in a collision. As
the Argo AV was attempting to make a right turn from El Camino Real onto Page Mill Road, a pedestrian entered the crosswalk. Argo’s
Vehicle Operator brought the vehicle to a complete stop and the vehicle directly behind the Argo AV made contact with the Argo AV’s rear

bumper. The Argo AV sustained minor damage to its rear bumper. The police were not called. The evening after the incident, minor injuries
were reported by the Argo Vehicle Operator located in the right seat.
