A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was making a right turn from northbound 10th Avenue onto
eastbound California Street when another vehicle made contact with the Cruise AV’s left rear bumper, damaging the upper rear fascia and
lower tail light assembly. The driver of the other vehicle drove away without exchanging information. Police were not called and no injuries

were reported at the scene by either party. The Cruise AV tester sitting in the driver seat did not report injuries on the scene but later
mentioned injuries.
