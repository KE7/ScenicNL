A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Mission street toward
the intersection with 29th Street. As it approached the intersection, the Cruise AV began to brake in response to a red light when a Honda
Civic traveling behind the Cruise AV made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AVâ€™s rear fascia and rear

right sensor. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and a police report was
later filed.
