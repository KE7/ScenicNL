On May 17, 2022 at 1:26 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger car on Stanyan Street at McAllister Street.

The Waymo AV was proceeding south on Stanyan Street in autonomous mode, and preparing to make a left turn onto McAllister Street. As
the Waymo AV entered the intersection, it slowed to yield to northbound traffic on Stanyan Street. A passenger car approached from behind
and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous
mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
