A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling in the rightmost lane on westbound
Pine Street between Polk Street and Larkin Street. A white Lexus traveling in the middle lane of westbound Pine Street alongside the Cruise
AV attempted to change into the rightmost lane in which the Cruise AV was traveling. Shortly thereafter, the white Lexus made contact
with the left rear door of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s left rear door. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without
exchanging information. There were no injuries and a police report was later filed.
