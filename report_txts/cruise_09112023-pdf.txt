A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
eastbound Bush Street in the second leftmost lane at the intersection with Sansome Street. As the AV attempted to maneuver into the left
turn lane, the AV slowed to a complete stop. A delivery truck traveling behind and to the left of the AV proceeded forward and attempted to
drive past the AV on the left. Shortly thereafter, the delivery truck made contact with the AV, damaging the AVâ€™s front driver side bumper

fascia and front driver side wheel opening molding. The driver of the delivery truck left the scene without exchanging information. There
were no reported injuries.
