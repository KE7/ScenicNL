A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode in a grocery store parking lot in Los Altos when a
passenger vehicle reversed into it. Three passengers were exiting the Waymo AV when the passenger vehicle in the right adjacent parking
spot began to reverse out of the parking spot and made contact with the Waymo AV’s passenger side rear quarter panel at approximately 1

MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its passenger side sliding rear door and rear quarter panel, and the passenger vehicle
sustained minor damage to its rear bumper. No injuries were reported.
