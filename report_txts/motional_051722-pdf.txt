The Motional vehicle was traveling on 4th Ave, between Brooks Ct and Broadway St, in Venice, CA in manual mode in the sole
northbound lane. While navigating the narrow two-lane, unstriped road, the safety driver slowed the vehicle to 1.5mph to allow a driver
coming in the opposite direction to navigate past the Motional vehicle. The other vehicle’s driver side wing mirror made contact with the
Motional vehicle’s driver side wing mirror and LIDAR casing, causing cosmetic damage. The safety driver pulled the vehicle to the side of
the road and exchanged information with the driver of the other vehicle.

There was one other vehicle involved, minor cosmetic damage to the Motional vehicle, minor cosmetic damage to the third-party vehicle,
and no injuries occurred due to the incident.
