A Zoox vehicle in autonomy had made a right turn from Oakdell Rd. onto Santa Cruz Ave. in Menlo Park, CA and was preparing to make
an immediate, unprotected left turn onto Sharon Road. The Zoox vehicle was slowing and moving at approximately 2 mph with its brake
lamps and left turn indicator illuminated, yielding to an oncoming vehicle with the right of way. A following vehicle - traveling at
approximately 24 mph - then struck the Zoox vehicle's right rear bumper, and that vehicle's driver airbag appeared to have deployed on
impact. The Zoox operator disengaged autonomy, proceeded with the left turn, and pulled over. The following vehicle continued its path of
travel, veered out of the lane, and collided with a tree on the left side of the road. The Menlo Park Police Department was called to the
scene. Two Zoox operators sustained minor injuries and it is unknown if the driver of the other vehicle sustained injuries.
