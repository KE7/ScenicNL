A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) traveling westbound on Filbert Street at Scott Street in San Francisco was involved in a
collision. After coming to a complete stop in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV switched to reverse gear in preparation for making a
multipoint turn. Within fractions of a second, the test driver applied the accelerator pedal to disengage autonomous mode. The Waymo AV
made contact with a passenger vehicle that was stopped behind it at approximately 3 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its
rear bumper, and the passenger vehicle sustained minor damage to its front bumper. No injuries were reported at the scene.
