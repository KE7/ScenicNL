A Cruise autonomous vehicle, operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Guerrero Street. The Cruise AV was making a
right turn onto 24th Street when a 2004 Toyota Sienna that was traveling straight on Guerrero made contact with the rear driver bumper of

the Cruise AV. This caused damage to the rear driver bumper and wheel well of the Cruise AV. There were no injuries and police were not
called.
