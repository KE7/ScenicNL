A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Gough Street between Rose and
Haight Streets when another vehicle, following closely behind the Cruise AV, made contact with the rear center bumper of the Cruise AV,
damaging two fastening clips on the underside of the Cruise AV’s rear bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called.
