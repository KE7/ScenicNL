A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound in the right lane on
Divisadero Street between Fulton Street and McAllister Street. The Cruise AV approached an eighteen-wheeler that was stopped in the right
lane of southbound Divisadero Street. The Cruise AV began to navigate around the eighteen-wheeler and stopped briefly as it was
completing its passing maneuver. Shortly thereafter, a Dodge Charger approached the stopped Cruise AV in the left lane and attempted to
pass the Cruise AV on the lefthand side. Contact was made with the Cruise AV, damaging the front left wheel, front left fender, front left
bumper, and front driver side mirror of the Cruise AV. The driver of the Dodge Charger left the scene without exchanging information.
There were no injuries and the Cruise AV was towed from the incident.
