A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in autonomous mode, entering the slip lane onto northbound Central
Expressway from the northbound S. Shoreline Boulevard ramp in Mountain View, when it began braking to yield to approaching traffic on
Central Expressway. As the Waymo AV slowed down, the Waymo AV test driver disengaged and brought the Waymo AV to a stop.
Moments later a passenger vehicle made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 15 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained
moderate damage to its rear bumper, and the other vehicle had moderate damage to its front bumper. No injuries were reported.
