On April 30, 2022 at 8:40 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle on 24th Street just past Guerrero Street.

The Waymo AV was in manual mode and parallel parked to the curb on westbound 24th Street when another passenger vehicle pulled up
behind the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV test driver reversed to exit the parking location shortly after the other passenger vehicle arrived
and the Waymo AV made contact with the passenger vehicle behind it. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not
engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
