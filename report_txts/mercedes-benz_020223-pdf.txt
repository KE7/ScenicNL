The subject Mercedes-Benz DRIVE PILOT test vehicle was traveling between 15 — 20 mph in the #2 northbound lane on the 605 Freeway
in California in stop and go traffic with the L3 ADS activated by the driver. The vehicle’s ADS determined that a truck traveling in the
adjacent lane had a trajectory towards the Drive Pilot’s lane, and so the Mercedes-Benz test vehicle autonomously applied the brakes to
avoid a collision. After applying the brakes and bringing itself to a standstill, the Mercedes-Benz was then struck in the rear bumper by a
trailing semi-truck that did not stop in time. No injuries were reported, no airbags deployed in either vehicle, and both vehicles were able to
be driven from the scene of the incident. The Mercedes-Benz vehicle experienced minor damage to the rear bumper, and no damage was
observed on the semi-truck at the scene. The CA Traffic Collision Report for the subject incident noted a violation of California Vehicle
Code 22350 (unsafe speed for traffic conditions) by the semi-truck in the #2 lane that struck the rear bumper of the Mercedes-Benz.
