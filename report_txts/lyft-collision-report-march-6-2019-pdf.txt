On March 6, 2019 at approximately 8:42 AM, a Lyft Autonomous Vehicle ("Lyft AV"), operating in full manual mode and heading
westbound on Alma Street in Palo Alto, made a minor contact with the rear bumper of a 3rd party vehicle during rainy and wet roadway
conditions. The driver of the Lyft AV applied the brakes while coming to a stop for traffic before making contact at a very low speed. The
Lyft AV sustained minor damage to a front sensor and brake. The 3rd party vehicle appeared to have very minor damage to the bumper but
neither driver could confirm at the time. There were no injuries reported and the police were not notified.
