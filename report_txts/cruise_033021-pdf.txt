A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was stopped while yielding to make a left turn from Southbound
on Folsom Street to Eastbound on 15th Street. Contact was made to the rear center bumper of the Cruise AV by a 2016 Ford Van that was
continuing straight on Folsom Street. The contact caused minimal damage to the rear center side bumper of the Cruise AV. The police were
not called. The day after the incident, minor injuries were reported by the Cruise AVTO and Passenger.
