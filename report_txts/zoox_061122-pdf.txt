A Zoox vehicle was in autonomy exiting a parking space on Halsey Ave. between S. Norfolk St. and Eisenhower St. in San Mateo, CA,
with a second vehicle stopped in the lane with its right turn indicator on, when a third vehicle overtook the second vehicle and cut in

abruptly from the left, making contact with the front left side and sensors of the Zoox vehicle as it was exiting the space. The Zoox operator
disengaged to manual mode just before the contact.
