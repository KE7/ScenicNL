A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Albion Street between 16th
Street and Camp Street. At the same time, a Ford pickup truck was traveling northbound on Albion Street partially in the AV’s lane of
travel. The AV stopped due to limited space to proceed forward due to the encroaching Ford pickup truck, and, shortly thereafter, the Ford
pickup truck made contact with the AV, damaging the AV’s rear driver side bumper fascia, rear driver side quarter panel and rear driver
side wheel molding. The driver of the Ford pickup truck left the scene without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
