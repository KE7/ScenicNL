A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was departing from the Three Embarcadero Center garage facility.

As the Cruise AV was leaving the garage, the garage gate began to lower and made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the roof Lidar
assembly. There were no reported injuries.
