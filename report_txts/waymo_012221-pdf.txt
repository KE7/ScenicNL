A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling eastbound on Precita Avenue and yielding to traffic while preparing to
merge onto Cesar Chavez in San Francisco when it was involved in a collision. While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV had come to a
complete stop at the stop sign at Precita Avenue at Cesar Chavez. As the Waymo AV proceeded slowly in preparation to merge, the Waymo
AV test driver disengaged autonomous mode and manually stopped the Waymo AV. A passenger vehicle behind the Waymo AV then made
contact with the stationary Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 7 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its rear
bumper, and the passenger vehicle sustained minor damage to its front bumper. No injuries were reported.
