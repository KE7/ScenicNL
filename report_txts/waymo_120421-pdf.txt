On December 4, 2021 at 4:10 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving an SUV on Winson Drive between 19th and 20th Avenues.

While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV turned right from southbound 19th Avenue onto westbound Winston Drive. As the Waymo
AV proceeded onto Winston Drive in the far right lane, an SUV also proceeding westbound on Winston Drive made a continuous right lane
change from the far left lane, through the middle lane, and entered the far right lane in front of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV was
decelerating when the test driver transitioned to manual mode. The Waymo AV then made contact with the SUV. At the time of the impact,
the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver (in the driver’s seating position) was operating the Waymo AV in manual
mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage to its front driver side fender and the SUV sustained damage to its front passenger side fender.
