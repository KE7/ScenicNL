A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was stopped at a red light on northbound Franklin Street at
the intersection with Bay Street when a lane-splitting motorcycle made contact with the Cruise AV’s front right articulating radar,
damaging the cover. The motorcyclist did not stop. There were no injuries and police were not called.
