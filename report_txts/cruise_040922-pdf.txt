A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was stopped at a red light on northbound Van Ness
Avenue at the intersection with Sacramento Street. The Cruise AV entered the intersection on a green light and continued straight through
the intersection before braking and coming to a complete stop near the end of the intersection. At the same time, a Toyota Sedan on
westbound Sacramento Street began was making an unprotected right turn on a red light onto northbound Van Ness Avenue behind the
Cruise AV. Shortly thereafter, the Toyota Sedan rear-ended the Cruise AV and made contact with the Cruise AV's rear bumper, damaging

the rear right bumper. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and a police
report was later filed.
