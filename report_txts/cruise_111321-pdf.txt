A Cruise autonomous vehicle (Cruise AV), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Ocean Avenue between
Lee Avenue and Harold Avenue. The Cruise AV was traveling 18.8 mph upon coming to the intersection with Lee Avenue on a green light.
As the Cruise AV entered the intersection, a 2014 Audi made a prohibited left turn from the rightmost westbound lane on Ocean Ave. The
Cruise AV hard braked prior to the Cruise AV operator disengaging the Cruise AV from autonomous mode. The Cruise AV operator
continued to hard brake while steering away from the approaching vehicle but, shortly thereafter, the 2014 Audi made contact with the
Cruise AV, damaging the front right of the Cruise AV and the front left bumper of the 2014 Audi. The Cruise AV was traveling 11.4 mph at
the time of contact. Police were not called to the scene and no injuries were reported.
