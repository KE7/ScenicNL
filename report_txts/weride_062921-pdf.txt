On June 29th 2021 at approximately 2:54 PM our safety driver was driving manually down First Street (a one way street) from San Carlos
Street on a sunny day at 20 MPH in downtown San Jose. While proceeding straight down First street, a car parallel to our vehicle initiated a
sudden lane change and began moving towards our vehicle from the bus only lane at about 10 MPH. At this point, our driver held the horn
down and applied the brakes. Our driver was unable to avoid the other vehicle due to the limited amount of space between our vehicle and
the other vehicle, and the side curb to the left. At this time the car was struck; collision was unavoidable. During this time, our driver was
approached by the occupants of the vehicle and information was exchanged. They said they were going to back up into the parking lot as
security said they couldn't stop there. Our driver attempted to back up but due to a grinding noise, stopped. At this point our driver went to
continue to get information but the occupants walked off and he couldn't abandon the vehicle. There was moderate damage to our vehicle
on the front bumper and passenger side wheel well in the form of deep dents and a small portion of the passenger side front bumper
