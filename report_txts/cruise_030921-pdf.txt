A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) operating in manual mode was traveling southwest on Folsom Street. When the Cruise AV
was turning right onto Fremont Street, it made contact with the curb at the front passenger tire. This caused damage to the front right tire of
the Cruise AV. There were no other vehicles or property involved. There were no injuries and the police were not called.
