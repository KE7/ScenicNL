An Apple vehicle, operating in manual mode and leaving a parking space in a San Diego retail parking lot, was struck at low speed on the
right front bumper by a Hyundai Sonata reversing from the middle of the parking lot. To try and avoid the crash, the Apple vehicle stopped

prior to being struck. Both vehicles sustained minor damage. At the time of the incident, no injuries were reported by either party and law
enforcement was not called to the scene.
