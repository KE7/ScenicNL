A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on 25th Avenue between
Clement Street and Geary Boulevard. The Cruise AV entered the intersection with Geary Boulevard on a green light. As the Cruise AV was
passing through the intersection, a black Volkswagen Hatchback traveling westbound on Geary Boulevard entered the intersection on a red
light and shortly thereafter made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the driver side doors of the Cruise AV. The driver of the

Volkswagen Hatchback left the scene without exchanging information. Police were called to the scene. There were no reported injuries and
the Cruise AV was towed from the scene.
