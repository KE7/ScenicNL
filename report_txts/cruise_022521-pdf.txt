A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), was in autonomous mode and traveling westbound on McAllister Street near Baker Street.
The AV came to a complete stop at the stop sign at McAllister and Baker. With no other vehicles present at the intersection and having the
right of way after the stop, the AV started to proceed left onto Baker Street from McAllister. As the AV was making the left turn, a Subaru
traveling northbound on Baker Street quickly approached the intersection, failed to stop for the stop sign and struck the front left side of the
Cruise AV. The AVTO disengaged from autonomous mode approximately 1.5 seconds before impact. The AVTOs sustained minor injuries
and the AV sustained damage to the driver's side bumper and wheel assembly. The police were called but did not respond to the scene.
