On April 1, 2022 at 2:27 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle on 19th Avenue at Lincoln Way.

The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode and proceeding southbound on 19th Avenue in the rightmost lane, with a passenger vehicle
traveling parallel in the left adjacent lane. As the two vehicles approached Lincoln Way, the passenger vehicle cut into the Waymo’s lane
and braked before turning right on Lincoln Way. As the passenger vehicle executed the right turn, the Waymo AV test driver transitioned to
manual mode, applied the brakes, but made contact with the passenger side rear corner of the passenger vehicle. At the time of the impact,
the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The other party
immediately left the scene of the event. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
