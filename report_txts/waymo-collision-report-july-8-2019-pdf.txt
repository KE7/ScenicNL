A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode on southbound Escuela Avenue at El Camino Real in
Mountain View when it was side-swiped. The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic at a red light when a passenger vehicle attempted to pass
the Waymo AV on the right, and made contact with a sensor on the Waymo AV’s passenger side front fender at approximately 1 MPH. The

Waymo AV’s sensor housing sustained a minor scratch, and the passenger vehicle sustained a minor scratch to its driver side mirror. There
were no injuries reported at the scene.
