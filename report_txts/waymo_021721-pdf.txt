A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling northbound on Shrader Street at Haight Street in San Francisco when it was
involved in a collision. While in manual mode, the Waymo AV test driver stopped the Waymo AV at a 4-way stop sign intersection on
Shrader Street at Haight Street, signaling to make a left turn. The Waymo AV test driver yielded to a passenger vehicle to their right (facing
westbound on Haight Street), allowing the passenger vehicle to enter the intersection before the Waymo AV test driver began to slowly
enter the intersection. When the passenger vehicle began to make a left turn in front of the Waymo AV from westbound Haight Street onto
southbound Shrader Street, the Waymo AV test driver stopped the Waymo AV. A passenger vehicle behind the Waymo AV then made
contact with the stationary Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 7 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its rear
bumper, and the passenger vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. No injuries were reported.
