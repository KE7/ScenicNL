A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Selby Street between
Palou Avenue and Oakdale Avenue. The Cruise AV came to a stop behind a semi-trailer truck that was slowly reversing diagonally onto
Selby Street from the intersection with Palou Avenue. As the semi-trailer truck began encroaching into the Cruise AV’s lane of travel, the
Cruise AV operator disengaged from autonomous into manual mode and began reversing the Cruise AV, causing the Cruise AV to back
into a different semi-trailer truck parked behind the Cruise AV. This caused damage to the Cruise AV’s rear passenger side wheel molding.
The Cruise AV operator left information for the other party and there were no reported injuries.
