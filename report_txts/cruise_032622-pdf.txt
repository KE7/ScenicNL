A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Greenwich Street
between Steiner Street and Fillmore Street. The Cruise AV approached a pickup truck that was reversing on eastbound Greenwich

Street and the Cruise AV stopped as the pickup truck continued to reverse. The pickup truck continued to reverse and made contact

with the Cruise AV, damaging the front bumper of the Cruise AV. There were no injuries and the Cruise AV was towed from the incident.
