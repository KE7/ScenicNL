A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on South Van Ness Street near the
Howard Street fork when another vehicle, turning right onto South Van Ness from Howard, made contact with the right rear corner of the
Cruise AV, causing damage to the Cruise AV’s rear bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called.
