At 2:06pm a WeRide driverless vehicle (car 1) was stopped behind a big rig truck (vehicle 2). As our vehicle (car 1) was stopped behind the
big rig truck, the big rig truck proceeded to reverse backwards and eventually collided into the WeRide vehicle (car 1). Both parties pulled

over both involved vehicles and cooperated to exchange information. The damage sustained to the WeRide vehicle was moderate and the big
rig truck did not have any damage.
