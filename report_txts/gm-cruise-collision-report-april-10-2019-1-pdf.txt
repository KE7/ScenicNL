A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Franklin Street at the
intersection with Ellis Street when the Cruise AV began to yield to a lane-splitting motorcyclist on its left rear. The driver of the Cruise AV
disengaged from autonomous mode, and shortly thereafter, the motorcyclist made contact with the Cruise AV’s front left radar, damaging
the radar’s casing. There were no injuries and police were not called. The motorcyclist did not stop.
