On June 21, 2022 at 12:21 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ("Waymo AV") operating in San Francisco, CA made contact with a
parking lot driveway on the 900 block of Brannan Street.

The Waymo AV approached a parking lot. As the Waymo AV turned left and into the parking lot, the Waymo AV's undercarriage made
contact with the driveway pavement (the AV did not contact any vehicle or road user). At the time of the contact, the Waymo AV's Level 4

ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver's seating position). The Waymo AV sustained minor
undercarriage damage.
