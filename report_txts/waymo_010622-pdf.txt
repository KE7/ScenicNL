On January 6, 2022 at 9:25 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle at Divisadero Street and Geary Boulevard.

While the Waymo AV was proceeding straight in manual mode in the right lane on northbound Divisadero Street, a passenger vehicle in the
left lane attempted an abrupt lane change at the entrance to the intersection at Geary Boulevard as the Waymo AV was approaching the
intersection. The front left fender of the Waymo AV made contact with the right front panel of the passenger vehicle. At the time of the

impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both vehicles
sustained moderate damage.
