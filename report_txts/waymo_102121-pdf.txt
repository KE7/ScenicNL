On October 21, 2021 at 1:55 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle at Larkin Street and O'Farrell Street.

While in manual mode, the Waymo AV was slowly approaching stopped traffic ahead when a vehicle in the right adjacent lane started
reversing into a parallel parking space. In the process, the front left bumper of the passenger vehicle scraped the right side panels and

bumper of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the
Waymo AV in manual mode. Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
