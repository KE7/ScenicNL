On January 1, 2021 at 2:04 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle at Marin Street and Kansas Street.

While proceeding straight in autonomous mode on westbound Marin Street, a passenger vehicle turned right onto Marin Street from Kansas
Street, crossing the center lane line and traveling in the oncoming traffic lane. The driver of the Waymo AV transitioned the system into
manual mode and slowed, and moved to the right most edge of the lane. The oncoming passenger vehicle struck the left side of the Waymo
AV and immediately proceeded to leave the scene of the collision. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not

engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained moderate damage to the left front panel
and both doors on the left side of the vehicle.
