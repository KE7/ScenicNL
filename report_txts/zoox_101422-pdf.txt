A Zoox vehicle was proceeding straight in autonomy through an intersection with a green light and right of way when vehicle 2 attempted
an illegal left turn across lanes of traffic into Zooxâ€™s right of way. The safety driver disengaged and applied max braking effort which

allowed Zoox to mitigate but not completely prevent the unavoidable collision. The Zoox vehicle struck the right front corner of vehicle 2.
No injuries were reported and the police were not called to the scene.
