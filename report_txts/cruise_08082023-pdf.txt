A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Pennsylvania Avenue
between 23rd Street and 25th Street when the AV approached a double-parked semi-trailer truck in the AV’s lane of travel. The AV began
to maneuver around and to the left of the semi-trailer truck and came to a stop for a stop sign at the intersection with 23rd Street. At the
same time, the semi-trailer truck proceeded forward and, shortly thereafter, made contact with the AV. This caused damage to the front
passenger side bumper fascia of the AV. The parties exchanged information and there were no reported injuries.
