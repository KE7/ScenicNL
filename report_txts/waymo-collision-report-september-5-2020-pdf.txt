A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (““Waymo AV”) was stopped at a stop sign intersection in manual mode at westbound Clement Street at
12th Avenue in San Francisco when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV test driver was yielding to a pedestrian in the crosswalk when a
passenger vehicle made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 6 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to
its rear bumper and hatch, and the passenger vehicle sustained minor damage to its front bumper. No injuries were reported.
