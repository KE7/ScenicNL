A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
eastbound Martin Luther King Jr. Drive at the intersection with Crossover Drive. A white Honda SUV approaching from the rear in the lane
to the left of the Cruise AV changed into the Cruise AV’s lane, came to a complete stop behind the Cruise AV, and then proceeded forward
to make contact with the rear driver side bumper of the Cruise AV. The white Honda SUV reversed backwards several feet, proceeded
forward, came to a complete stop, and then proceeded forward to make contact with the Cruise AV again. This caused damage to the Cruise

AV’s rear driver side fascia. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. Both Cruise AV operators
reported injuries.
