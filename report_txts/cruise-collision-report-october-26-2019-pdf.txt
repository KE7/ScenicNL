A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southeast bound on The Embarcadero near the
intersection with Battery Street when the Cruise AV yielded to another vehicle in the left adjacent lane that encroached into the Cruise AV’s
lane. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, a second vehicle behind the Cruise AV made
contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right rear bumper, fascia, signal lamp, and radar assembly. There

were no injuries reported at the scene by either party and police were not called. Both of the Cruise AV test operators later mentioned neck
and back injuries.
