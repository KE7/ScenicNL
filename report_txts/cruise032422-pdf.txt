A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Point Lobos
Avenue between 48th Avenue and Balboa Street. The Cruise AV was traveling downhill when a cyclist approached the Cruise AV from
behind. The Cruise AV began to brake, and shortly thereafter, the cyclist made contact with the rear window of the Cruise AV. The cyclist
fell to the ground and sustained injuries. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called. The cyclist was transferred from

the scene via EMS. The impact caused damage to the rear passenger side of the bumper, rear hatch, and rear window of the Cruise AV.
