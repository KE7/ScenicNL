A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was reversing into a parking spot on westbound Hayes Street
between Pierce Street and Scott Street. While reversing, the Cruise AV made contact with the front bumper of a Honda SUV that was

parked behind the Cruise AV. This caused damage to the front bumper of the Honda SUV. There were no injuries and police were not
called.
