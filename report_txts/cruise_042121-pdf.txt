A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode was turning from Southbound on Folsom Street to Westbound
on 15th Street. When the Cruise AV stopped to yield for an oncoming vehicle, a Chevrolet Silverado that was traveling behind made contact

with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV. This caused damage to the rear bumper of the Cruise AV. At the time of the incident, the driver of
the Cruise AV reported a minor injury, but emergency services were not called.
