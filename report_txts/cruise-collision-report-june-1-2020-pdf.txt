A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was coming to a complete stop in response to stopped traffic
on southwest bound Mission Street near the intersection with 10th Street when another vehicle approaching from the rear made contact with
the Cruise AV’s rear bumper, damaging the rear right fascia light bracket. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging
information. Both of the Cruise AV test operators mentioned back pain at the scene but police were not called.
