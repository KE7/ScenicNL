On March 20, 2023 at 10:43 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (““Waymo AV”) operating in Los Angeles, California was in a
collision involving an SUV on Venice Boulevard at La Cienega.

The Waymo AV was stopped in the center lane of a three-lane road behind a passenger vehicle for a red light facing southwest on Venice
Boulevard at La Cienega in autonomous mode. The light turned green while cross-traffic remained backed up in the intersection. The
Waymo AV nudged forward and slowed to a stop, yielding for the blocking cross traffic. A passenger vehicle that had been stopped behind
the Waymo AV proceeded forward and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4
ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained damage.
