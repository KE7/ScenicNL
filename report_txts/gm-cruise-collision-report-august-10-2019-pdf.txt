A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Noe Street at the intersection
with 14th Street when the Cruise AV yielded to a pedestrian in the north crosswalk. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from
autonomous mode, and shortly thereafter, another vehicle attempting a left turn from southbound Noe onto eastbound 14th made contact

with the left rear corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s left rear fascia and wheel well. There were no injuries reported at the
scene by either party and police were not called.
