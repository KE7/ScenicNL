A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound in the right lane of
traffic on Mission Street between Randall Street and Appleton Avenue. The Cruise AV stopped behind and to the left of a Hyundai Elantra
that was stopped beside the right curb of Mission Street. The driver was standing beside the Hyundai Elantra with the driver door open into
the lane of traffic. The Hyundai Elantra then rolled backwards at an angle and, shortly thereafter, made contact with the Cruise AV,
damaging the front passenger door, rear passenger quarter panel, rear passenger bumper, and rear passenger wheel of the Cruise AV. The
driver of the Hyundai Elantra left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and a police report was later filed.
