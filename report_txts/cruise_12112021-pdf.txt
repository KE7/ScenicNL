A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
northbound Larkin Street at the intersection with Turk Street. The Cruise AV entered the intersection on a green light and continued
straight when a cyclist traveling eastbound on Turk Street entered the crosswalk. The Cruise AV braked to the cyclist and, shortly thereafter,
another vehicle traveling behind the Cruise AV made contact with the Cruise AV's rear bumper, damaging the rear left bumper. The driver
of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and police were not called.
