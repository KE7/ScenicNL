A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
10th Street at the intersection with Division Street. The Cruise AV began to make a right turn onto Division Street after the light turned
green before yielding to a pedestrian in the crosswalk. Shortly thereafter, a silver Infiniti Sedan traveling behind the Cruise AV made

contact with the Cruise AV’s rear bumper, causing damage to the Cruise AV’s rear fascia. The driver of the Infiniti Sedan left the scene
without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
