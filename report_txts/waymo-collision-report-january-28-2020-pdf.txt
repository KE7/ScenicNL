A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was being driven in manual mode and attempting to exit Santiago Villa Mobile Home Park
in Mountain View by turning right from southbound Oro Way to westbound Space Park Way when it made contact with a stationary object.
The Waymo AV’s test driver was making a sharp right turn and the Waymo AV’s rear passenger side door and wheel well scraped a wall at
approximately 1 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage. No injuries were reported at the scene.
