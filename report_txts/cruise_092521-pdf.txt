A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was traveling northbound on 3rd Street between Marin Street and
Cesar Chavez Street. As the Cruise AV was stopped behind another vehicle, a 2020 Chevy Bolt behind the Cruise AV made contact with

the Cruise AV, damaging the rear center bumper of the Cruise AV. The Cruise AV operator reported injuries. Police were not called to the
scene.
