A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) parked in conventional mode was involved in a collision on southwest bound San Jose Avenue
between Farallones and Broad Streets. While the Cruise AV was parked parallel to the curb on the street, another vehicle in front of the
Cruise AV made contact with the front bumper of the Cruise AV while reversing out of its parking spot, damaging the Cruise AV’s front
right fascia. There were no injuries and police were not called.
