A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southeast bound on Spear Street between
Howard and Folsom Streets when the Cruise AV slowed down to change into the right adjacent lane due to traffic cones ahead. The driver
of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, a lane-splitting car made contact with the right rear corner of
the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right lower tail lamp. The driver of the other vehicle drove away without exchanging
information. There were no injuries reported. Police were called but were not dispatched to the scene.
