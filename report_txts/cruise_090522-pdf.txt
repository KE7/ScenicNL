A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Sacramento Street
between Van Ness Avenue and Polk Street. The Cruise AV approached a semi-trailer truck that was stopped in the left lane of traffic. The
Cruise AV stopped before maneuvering into the bus and taxi lane to pass the semi-trailer truck. As the Cruise AV was slowly maneuvering
around the semi-trailer truck and merging back into the left lane of traffic, a Honda Accord traveling behind the Cruise AV attempted to
pass the Cruise AV and made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the rear passenger side bumper of the Cruise AV. The driver of the
Honda Accord left the scene without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
