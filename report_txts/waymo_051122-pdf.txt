On May 11, 2022 at 9:19 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a SUV on 24th Street and Capp Street.

The Waymo AV was attempting to make a right turn from 24th Street onto Capp Street while yielding to a pedestrian in the adjacent
crosswalk in autonomous mode. A SUV approaching from behind the Waymo AV passed on the left side, making contact with the Waymo
AV’s rear left sensor housing. The Waymo AV operator transitioned the system from autonomous to manual mode just before the moment
of impact. The SUV immediately left the scene. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver
was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
