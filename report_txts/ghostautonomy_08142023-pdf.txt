A registered Ghost AV Test vehicle was hit by crash debris while traveling on 1-680 N. The Ghost vehicle neither hit nor was hit by another
vehicle. The Ghost car was traveling in AV mode with a registered AV Test Driver behind the wheel and an additional Safety Co-Driver in
the passenger seat. Traffic slowed quickly due to a crash ahead of the Ghost car. Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control
by braking and disengaging the autonomous system. The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car. A Mercedes car
immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car. Ghost's understanding based on communications
at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the
Mercedes and rolled over. To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured. The Ghost drivers heard a noise and then

found that the rear bumper of the Ghost car had been damaged, which Ghost believes resulted from crash debris. The Ghost drivers drove
the Ghost car back to the garage in conventional mode.
