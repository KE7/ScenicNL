On August 13, 2021 at 8:04 AM PDT, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco was in a collision
involving a van at Oakdale Avenue and Toland Street. While in manual mode and traveling northwest on Oakdale Avenue, the Waymo AV
was approaching slower lead traffic at the stop sign intersection at Toland Street. As the Waymo AV’s operator (in the driver’s seating

position) slowed the Waymo AV, a van made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to the
underside of its rear bumper; the van did not appear to sustain damage.
