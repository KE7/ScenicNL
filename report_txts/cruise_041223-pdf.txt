A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Turk Street Street
between Webster Street and Laguna Street. The Cruise AV came to a complete stop for a double-parked Sedan in the leftmost lane. The
Cruise AV began to maneuver around and to the right of the Sedan when the Sedan reversed into the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s
front driver side bumper. The driver of the Sedan left the scene without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
