A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Potrero Avenue
between 15th Street and 16th Street. The Cruise AV approached the intersection with 16th Street as a Toyota Tundra traveling southbound
on Potrero Avenue was making a right turn onto westbound 16th street. The Toyota Tundra was yielding for pedestrians and blocking the
bike lane on southbound Potrero Avenue with Cyclist 1 and Cyclist 2 approaching. The Cruise AV braked for the two cyclists as Cyclist 3
traveling behind the Cruise AV veered left to avoid another vehicle pulling out of a curbside parking spot. Cyclist 3 then made contact with

the right rear bumper of the Cruise AV, falling off their bike. Cyclist 3 reported minor injuries related to the incident and police were not
called.
