A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Bryant Street in the
rightmost lane between 11th Street and 10th Street. As the Cruise AV proceeded straight into the intersection with 10th Street, a semi-trailer
truck traveling in the lane to the left of the Cruise AV began to make a right turn onto 10th Street and crossed into the Cruise AVâ€™s lane
without a turn signal. The Cruise AV braked and the semi-trailer truck made contact with the left side of the Cruise AV, causing damage to
the driver side front, rear, and bumper of the Cruise AV. The parties exchanged information and there were no injuries.
