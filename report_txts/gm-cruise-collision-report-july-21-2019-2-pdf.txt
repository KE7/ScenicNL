A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) being driven in conventional mode was involved in a collision while traveling in a private
parking lot on the north side of Market Street near the intersection of Duboce Avenue and Church Street. While the driver of the Cruise AV
was proceeding towards the parking lot exit, another vehicle reversing out of its perpendicular parking spot made contact with the front right

side of the Cruise AV. Police were not called and no injuries were reported at the scene by either party. The Cruise AV tester sitting in the
front passenger seat later mentioned a back injury.
