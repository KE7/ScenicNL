On June 1, 2022 at 7:26 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving an SUV on McAllister Street at Franklin Street.

While the Waymo AV was stopped at a red light on eastbound McAllister Street, an SUV that had previously been stopped behind the
Waymo AV rolled forward and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS
was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
