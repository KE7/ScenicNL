On July 29, 2023 at 2:57 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in Santa Monica, California was in a collision
involving a cyclist on Colorado Avenue near Ocean Avenue.

The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic on southwestbound Colorado Avenue when a cyclist that had been traveling behind the Waymo AV
passed the Waymo AV on the right. As the cyclist passed the Waymo AV, the cyclist made contact with the front passenger side sensor of
the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present

(in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained damage and the cyclist did not stop, leaving the scene without exchanging
information.
