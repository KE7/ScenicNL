A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was stopped for a passenger pick-up in the AV’s lane of
travel on northbound Scott Street between Oak Street and Page Street. After picking up the passenger while the AV remained stopped, a
white Mercedes-Benz Metris reversed out of a driveway and made contact with the AV, damaging the AV’s front driver side door and front
driver side auxiliary mirror. The parties exchanged information and there were no reported injuries.
