A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Polk Street near the
intersection with Clay Street. Shortly after passing through the intersection with Clay Street, the Cruise AV made contact with a downed
power cable stretching across Polk Street and came to a stop. This caused damage to the Cruise AVâ€™s front fascia. There were no injuries.
Cruise was informed by law enforcement to keep the Cruise AV stationary until the power cables were cleared. During the time that the
power cable was being cleared and that the Cruise AV was stopped, the Cruise AV ran low on battery power and did not have enough
power to return to Cruise facilities on its own. The Cruise AV was therefore towed from the scene once the power cables were cleared.
