A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on eastbound
McAllister Street at the intersection with Scott Street. Another vehicle approaching from the rear made contact with the Cruise AV's rear

bumper, damaging the rear left bumper. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no
injuries and police were not called.
