On November 19, 2019 at approximately 2:04pm in clear weather, a Lyft Autonomous Vehicle (“Lyft AV”) was travelling at 29.6mph in
autonomous mode northbound in the right lane on El Camino Real Blvd in Palo Alto, CA when the Safety Driver commanded manual mode
with steering and brake inputs in immediate reaction to the third party vehicle in the adjacent center lane abruptly cutting in to the AV's lane,
apparently attempting to make a last-second right turn onto Medical Foundation Drive. Approximately 1.5 seconds later, the third party vehicle
collided with AV which was then travelling at 14mph. The third party passenger vehicle made contact with the Lyft AV’s front left lidar sensor
and the driver side fender. Damage was limited to the third party’s passenger side door and passenger side fender, and the Lyft AV’s front
bumper, left bumper lidar sensor and driver side fender. No injuries were reported and law enforcement was not called.
