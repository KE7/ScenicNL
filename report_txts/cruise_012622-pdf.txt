A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on 10th Street between
Howard Street and Mission Street. The Cruise AV was traveling 24.9 mph upon coming to the intersection with Howard Street on a green
light. As the Cruise AV entered the intersection, a 2021 Range Rover was traveling the wrong way on a one-way section of Howard Street.
The 2021 Range Rover was traveling eastbound on Howard Street and entered the intersection on a red light. The Cruise AV braked prior to
the Cruise AV operator disengaging the Cruise AV from autonomous mode. The Cruise AV operator continued to brake while steering
away from the approaching vehicle but, shortly thereafter, the 2021 Range Rover made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the front

right of the Cruise AV and the front left bumper of the 2021 Range Rover. The Cruise AV was traveling 11.2 mph at the time of contact.
Police were called to the scene and no injuries were reported.
