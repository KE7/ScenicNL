A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound in the rightmost lane on
16th Street between Mission Street and Wiese Street. Ahead of the Cruise AV, a delivery truck was double-parked in the rightmost lane of
eastbound 16th Street. The Cruise AV began to maneuver around the double-parked vehicle by changing lanes. At the same time, a 2010
Honda Civic traveling behind the Cruise AV in the rightmost lane also began to maneuver and increase speed into the leftmost lane. Shortly
thereafter, contact was made with the Cruise AV's side door, damaging the front driver side door and radar assembly. There were no

reported injuries at the scene by either party and police were not called. The driver of the Honda Civic later claimed injuries related to the
event.
