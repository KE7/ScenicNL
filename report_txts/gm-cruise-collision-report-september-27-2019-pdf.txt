A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Clay Street at the intersection
with Kearny Street when the Cruise AV slowed down. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly
thereafter, a bicyclist proceeding straight on northbound Kearny Street made contact with the right rear fender of the Cruise AV, damaging
its fender. The bicyclist left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and police were not called.
