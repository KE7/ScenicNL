On December 29, 2022 at 3:15 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on 3rd Street and Mariposa Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped facing north on 3rd Street for a red light in the right lane of the three-lane street while in autonomous mode. A
passenger vehicle approached from behind and stopped behind the Waymo AV before eventually proceeding forward and making contact
with the rear of the Waymo AV while the AV was still stopped at the red light. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS
was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo sustained damage.
