A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on 14th Street at the intersection with
Valencia Street when another vehicle began to change into the Cruise AV’s lane. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous

mode and, shortly thereafter, the other vehicle made contact with the right front corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right
front fender. There were no injuries and police were not called.
