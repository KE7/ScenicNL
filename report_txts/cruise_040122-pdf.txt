A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Bush Street toward the
intersection with Larkin Street. The Cruise AV was traveling in the leftmost lane of three lanes of traffic. As the Cruise AV approached the
intersection on a green light, a red SUV traveling in the same direction eastbound on Bush Street remained stopped in the middle lane at the
intersection with Larkin Street. As the Cruise AV began to enter the intersection, the red SUV made a prohibited left turn onto Larkin Street
from the middle lane on Bush Street, across both the left lane in which the Cruise AV was traveling and a lefthand turn lane. The Cruise AV
braked to avoid the SUV turning into its lane and, shortly thereafter, the red SUV made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the passenger

side fender and front facia of the Cruise AV. The driver of the red SUV left the scene without exchanging information. There were no
injuries and Cruise filed a police report.
