On February 9, 2022 at 3:05 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a pick-up truck on Coral Road at Wisconsin Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on Coral Road in autonomous mode and came to a stop while yielding to an oncoming pick-up
truck in a narrow roadway. The oncoming truck continued proceeding straight and made contact with the rear left sensor of the Waymo AV.

At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s
seating position). Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
