A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in conventional mode, was involved in an incident. The Cruise AV was exiting a
parking lot and turning right onto southbound Mission Street between France Ave and Italy Ave when it made contact with the left rear
bumper of a parked vehicle. This caused damage to the passenger rear quarter panel and passenger rear door of the Cruise AV. There was
no damage to the parked vehicle. There were no injuries and the police were not called.
