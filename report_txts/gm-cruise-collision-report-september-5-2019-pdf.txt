A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) being driven in conventional mode was involved in a collision after completing a right turn
from southwest bound Market Street onto westbound Haight Street at the intersection with Gough Street. As the driver of the Cruise AV
proceeded on Haight through Gough, a motor scooterist, proceeding southbound on Gough through the intersection with Haight, made
contact with the right rear passenger door of the Cruise AV, denting the door. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party.
Police were called but not dispatched to the scene. Days after the collision, the motor scooterist reported injuries.
