A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southeast bound on 11th Street between
Howard and Folsom Streets when the Cruise AV slowed down for a passing motorcyclist behind it. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged
from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, the motorcyclist made contact with the left rear corner of the Cruise AV. The collision
resulted in damage to both the Cruise AV and the motorcycle. There were no injuries and police were not called.
