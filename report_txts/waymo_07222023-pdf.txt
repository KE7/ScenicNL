On July 22, 2023 at 11:11 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle on 13th Street east of Folsom Street.

The Waymo AV was facing east while stopped just left of the right turn lane on 13th Street, with stopped traffic to the right. After waiting
to merge, the Waymo AV reversed slightly to reroute and while doing so, a sensor on the right front of the Waymo AV made contact with

the left rear side of a vehicle in the right turn lane. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous
mode. The other vehicle sustained damage.
