A Zoox vehicle was in autonomous mode while making a right lane change on Montgomery St facing north towards Clay St. A car entered

traffic from a stop sign intersection on right without stopping and struck the Zoox vehicle's rear passenger side door, causing moderate
damage. There were no injuries and police were not called.
