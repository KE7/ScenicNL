On January 3, 2021 at 9:00 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a heavy truck at the northbound merge lane on the 100 block of Bayshore Boulevard.

At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s
seating position). While attempting a merge onto northbound Bayshore Boulevard from southbound Bayshore Boulevard, the Waymo AV
came to a stop to yield for approaching traffic on the right. The Waymo AV was rear ended by the truck, causing minor damage to the right
rear bumper of the Waymo AV. The truck sustained damage to the left front bumper.
