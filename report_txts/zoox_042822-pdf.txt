A Zoox vehicle in autonomous mode came to a complete stop at the T-junction stop sign at Colin P. Kelly Jr. St. and Brannan St. and
yielded to oncoming traffic from the left. Due to traffic flow, the driver then disengaged autonomous mode and reversed, making contact

with a vehicle that had approached from the rear and was attempting to pass the Zoox vehicle to make a right turn. There were no injuries
and the police were not called.
