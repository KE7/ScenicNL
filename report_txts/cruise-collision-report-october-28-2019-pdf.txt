A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southeast bound on Howard Street near the
intersection with 9th Street when a bicyclist in the right adjacent dedicated bike lane veered away from a wayward pedestrian throwing an
unknown object in the bicyclist's direction in the crosswalk. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly
thereafter, the bicyclist veered into the Cruise AV's lane and made contact with the right front passenger door of the Cruise AV. No injuries
were reported at the scene by either party. Police were called but not dispatched to the scene. The bicyclist later reported injuries.
