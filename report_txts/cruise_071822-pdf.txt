A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on 16th Avenue between
Lomita Avenue and Lawton Street. At the same time, a red Honda Sedan traveling behind the Cruise AV maneuvered into the oncoming
lane and increased speed as it attempted to pass the Cruise AV to the left. Shortly thereafter, contact was made with the Cruise AV's front
driver side mirror, damaging the front driver side mirror of the Cruise AV. The driver of the red Honda Sedan left the scene without
exchanging information. There were no injuries and a police report was later filed.
