On March 28, 2022, while in supervised (““Drivered”) autonomous mode traveling eastbound on Tustin Ranch Rd in Tustin, CA, a Pony.ai
Autonomous Vehicle drove over a temporary sign that had previously fallen over and was lying flat on its side in the travel lane. The impact
redirected the vehicle towards the curb. The Safety Operator took control, braked, and steered the vehicle away from the direction of the

curb. The right front tire scraped the right curb. The vehicle sustained minor damage to the right front strut and control arm. There were no
injuries and no other vehicles involved. The Safety Operator drove the vehicle back to Pony.ai’s Irvine facility.
