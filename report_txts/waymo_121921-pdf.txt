On December 19, 2021 at 10:30 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle at Fulton Street and Sth Avenue.

At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s
seating position). The Waymo AV was stopped facing southwest on Fulton Street while yielding to pedestrians in a crosswalk when a

passenger vehicle reversed at a low speed from an adjacent driveway into the right rear bumper of the Waymo AV. Both vehicles sustained
minor damage.
