Our Autonomous vehicle (car 1) was in conventional mode stopped at the traffic light on Embarcadero and Washington. A black color
Dodge Challenger (car 2) attempted to bypass our car (car 1) from the rear and in doing so hit our car (car 1) right side rear bumper. At the
time of collision our AV (Car 1) was stopped traveling 0 mph and the Dodge Challenger (car 2) was traveling less than 5 mph. The damage
is minor and left a small scratch. After exchanging information both parties agreed to leave the scene
