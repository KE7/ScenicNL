A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Folsom Street in the
leftmost lane between 9th Street and 10th Street. At the same time, a Model 3 Tesla traveling in the adjacent center lane veered into the
Cruise AV’s lane without a turn signal. Shortly thereafter, contact was made with the Cruise AV’s front passenger side quarter panel and

mirror, damaging the front passenger side quarter panel, front passenger side mirror and front passenger side radar assembly. The parties
exchanged information and there were no reported injuries.
