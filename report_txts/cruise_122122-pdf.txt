A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Brannan Street
between Ritch Street and 3rd Street. At the same time, a black BMW traveling eastbound on Brannan Street swerved into oncoming traffic
and in front of the Cruise AV. The AV operator disengaged from autonomous into manual mode and braked to avoid the oncoming BMW,
but shortly thereafter, contact was made with the Cruise AV's front right quarter panel, damaging the front passenger side of the Cruise AV.

The BMW then struck a parked vehicle that was beside the Cruise AV. The driver of the BMW fled the scene on foot. There were no
reported injuries.
