A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was making a right turn from 16th Street onto northbound
Guerrero Street when another vehicle, entering traffic from a curbside parked position on westbound 16th Street, made contact with the
right rear corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s rear right bumper, wheel well, and rear parking sensor. The driver of the
other vehicle drove away without exchanging information. There were no injuries and police were not called.
