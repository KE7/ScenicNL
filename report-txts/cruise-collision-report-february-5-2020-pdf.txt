A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV") being driven in conventional mode was involved in a collision on eastbound Bush Street near
the intersection with Jones Street. While the driver of the Cruise AV was stopped in traffic, another vehicle made contact with the rear
bumper of the Cruise AV. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party and police were not called. The Cruise AV test
operator sitting in the front passenger seat later mentioned neck and back pain.
