A Zoox vehicle traveling in autonomous mode on Broadway St. towards Powell St. encountered a double-parked flatbed truck. The Zoox
vehicle began to maneuver around the stationary truck and made slight contact with the left rear of the truck, causing a scrape on the
passenger-side door of the Zoox vehicle; there was no damage to the truck. There were no injuries and police were not called.
