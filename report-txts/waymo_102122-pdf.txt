On October 21, 2022 at 8:27 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California made contact
with the pavement on a steep hill on Filbert Street at Kearny Street.

The Waymo AV was on a steep hill, turning from Filbert Street onto Kearny Street, when the Waymo AV's undercarriage made contact
with the pavement (the AV did not contact any vehicle or road user). At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged
in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained damage.
