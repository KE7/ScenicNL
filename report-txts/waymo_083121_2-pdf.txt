On August 31,2021 at 5:41 PM PDT, Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco was in a collision
involving an unoccupied parked passenger vehicle at 20 Cook Street. While performing a multipoint turn at the north end of Cook Street (a
dead-end road), the Waymo AV was in reverse at approximately 2 MPH when it made contact with the front driver’s side door of an
unoccupied parked passenger vehicle. The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode until just before making contact, when the test driver
transitioned the Waymo AV into manual mode. The contact caused minor scuffing and a small dent in the door handle of the parked
vehicle’s driver door and minor damage to the plastic sensor housing on the Waymo AV’s rear passenger’s side.
