On February 6, 2022 at 1:53 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on Pine Street at Fillmore Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped in the right lane of a three lane, one-way street in manual mode while boarding a passenger. A passenger
vehicle stopped behind the Waymo AV then attempted to go around the Waymo AV, attempting to merge with traffic in the center lane but
colliding instead with a third passenger vehicle and also making contact with the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s
Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV and the passenger vehicle
that made contact with it sustained moderate damage. The third vehicle sustained minor damage. The Waymo AV passenger reported minor
discomfort at the scene but advised they did not require medical attention.
