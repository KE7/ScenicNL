On September 17, 2022 at 6:38 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving an SUV on Potrero Avenue and 24th Street.

While traveling northbound on Potrero Avenue, the Waymo AV changed lanes from the center lane to the right lane before slowing to a
stop at a red light at 24th Street. While the Waymo AV was making the lane change, the vehicle immediately behind the Waymo AV in the
right lane moved to the center lane and made contact with the right rear sensor of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo

AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The SUV sustained
damage.
