On June 5, 2023 at 12:53 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a van in a parking lot at 3911 3rd Street.

The Waymo AV came to a stop while yielding to a pickup truck which was reversing into a perpendicular parking space in front of the
Waymo AV. While the Waymo AV was stopped, a van which was in a parking space immediately to the right of the Waymo AV began
reversing out of the parking space. The rear of the van made contact with the right side of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV sustained
damage. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode.
