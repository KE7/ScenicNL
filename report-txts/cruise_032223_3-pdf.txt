A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Turk Boulevard
between Roselyn Terrace and Kittredge Terrace. The Cruise AV came to a complete stop for a vehicle in the process of letting passengers
out that was stopped in the Cruise AV’s lane of travel. A Smart Car traveling behind the Cruise AV came to a complete stop behind the
Cruise AV. A Honda Accord trailing behind the Smart Car began to decelerate but made contact with the Smart Car, pushing the Smart Car

forward into the Cruise AV’s rear bumper. The parties exchanged information. There were no damages to the Cruise AV and there were no
reported injuries.
