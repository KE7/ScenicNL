A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a stop sign on
eastbound 17th Street at the intersection with Vermont Street. As the AV began to proceed straight, a gray Honda Odyssey traveling
westbound on 17th Street on the opposite side of the intersection from the AV entered the intersection and veered into the AV’s lane of
travel. The AV stopped in response as the Honda Odyssey continued traveling in the AV’s lane of travel through the intersection and,
shortly thereafter, the Honda Odyssey made contact with the AV, damaging the front and rear driver side doors, front driver side radar

assembly and rear driver side tire of the AV. The parties exchanged information. There were no reported injuries and the AV was towed
from the scene.
