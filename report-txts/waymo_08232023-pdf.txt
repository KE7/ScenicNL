On August 23, 2023 at 9:54 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a heavy truck on Mason Street at Vandewater Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling northbound on Mason Street when it approached a heavy truck and trailer that was stopped in the adjacent
lane on the left side of the street. As the Waymo began to slowly pass the truck, the truck initiated a reversing turn maneuver into a loading
bay on the left side of Mason Street. The Waymo AV then came to a stop, and as the Waymo AV was initiating its own reversing maneuver
to clear the path for the truck, the right side of the trailer made contact with the front driver’s side corner of the Waymo AV. At the time of
the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage.
