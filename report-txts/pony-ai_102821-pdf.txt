On October 28, 2021, after turning right onto Fremont Blvd from Cushing Pkwy, the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle ("Pony.ai AV")
performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode. While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a
center divider on Fremont Blvd. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front
of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to

report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the
damaged sign.
