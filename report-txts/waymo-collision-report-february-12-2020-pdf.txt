A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was being driven in manual mode on northbound Midvale Avenue approaching La Grange
Avenue in Los Angeles when the Waymo AV’s right side mirror made contact with the left side mirror of a parked vehicle. The Waymo
AV’s test driver was attempting to move to the right to give space to an oncoming vehicle when it made contact with the parked vehicle’s

left side mirror while traveling at approximately 16 MPH. The side mirror on the Waymo AV and side mirror on the parked vehicle both
sustained minor damage. No injuries were reported at the scene.
