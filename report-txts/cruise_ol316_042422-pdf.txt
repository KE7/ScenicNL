A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Steiner Street toward
the intersection with Eddy Street. The Cruise AV began to brake for the stop sign on Steiner Street at the intersection with Eddy Street when
a white BMW traveling behind the Cruise AV made contact with the rear driver side bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s

rear fascia. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and a police report was
later filed.
