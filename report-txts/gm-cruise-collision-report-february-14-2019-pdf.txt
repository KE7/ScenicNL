Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Gough Street at the intersection
with Fell Street when the Cruise AV began to yield to a car on its right. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode,
and shortly thereafter, another vehicle made contact with the center rear bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the rear radar mounting
bracket of the Cruise AV. There were no injuries and police were not called.
