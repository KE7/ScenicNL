On August 16th, 2022 at 3:52 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a SUV on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive at 25th Avenue.

The Waymo AV was traveling West on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and stopped at the stop sign at the intersection with 25th Avenue. As
the Waymo AV slowed to a stop, a SUV traveling in the opposite lane, East on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, crossed the intersection with
25th Avenue and came to a stop in the opposite lane, next to the Waymo AV. After stopping, the SUV began moving again and the front

left corner of the SUV made contact with the left side of the Waymo AV. The SUV then left the scene. The Waymo AV sustained minor
damage.
