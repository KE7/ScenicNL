A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode on the off-ramp from westbound Alma Street to
southbound Oregon Expressway in Palo Alto when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV was yielding to cross-traffic when a passenger
vehicle made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 5 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to the rear

bumper, and the passenger vehicle left the scene without stopping or exchanging information. The Waymo AV driver complained of neck,
back, and nose pain and was treated at the scene by emergency responders.
