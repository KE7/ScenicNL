On December 17, 2022 at 1:50 PM PST, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a passenger car on Embarcadero near the intersection with Folsom Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling southbound on Embarcadero in autonomous mode when it slowed and stopped for a parallel parking vehicle
ahead. A passenger car following the Waymo AV made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of impact, the Waymo AV's
Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode with a test driver present (in the driver's seating position). Both vehicles sustained damage.
