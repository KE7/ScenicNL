A Zoox vehicle in manual mode was stopped northbound at the intersection of Montgomery St and Broadway at a red traffic light when
another vehicle making a left turn from westbound Broadway onto southbound Montgomery St erratically veered toward the Zoox vehicle,
resulting in a low speed collision with our front bumper. The driver initially stopped and partially opened the drivers door, but then drove
away from the scene. Police were not called and no injuries were reported.
