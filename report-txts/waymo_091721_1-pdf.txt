On September 17, 2021 at 12:30 PM PDT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle at York Street and Cesar Chavez. The Waymo AV was waiting to turn right onto Cesar Chavez in
autonomous mode when the driver transitioned to manual mode. A passenger vehicle was in the process of completing a right turn from
Cesar Chavez onto York Street and made contact with the front left fender of the stopped Waymo AV, before proceeding straight through
the narrow roadway. The Waymo sustained minor damage to the fender. The other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information.
