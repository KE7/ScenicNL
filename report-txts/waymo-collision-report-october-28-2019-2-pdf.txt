A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was in autonomous mode and beginning to proceed at a green traffic light to turn left from
northbound Castro Street to northbound Central Expressway in Mountain View when it was rear-ended at approximately 6 MPH by a

passenger vehicle. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to the rear bumper, and the passenger vehicle left the scene without exchanging
information. There were no injuries reported at the scene.
