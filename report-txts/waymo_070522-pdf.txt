On July 5, 2022 at 3:26 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle on 17th Street at Wisconsin Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on 17th Street when it detected a siren from a nearby emergency vehicle. As the Waymo AV
slowed, a passenger vehicle made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was
engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles sustained damage.
