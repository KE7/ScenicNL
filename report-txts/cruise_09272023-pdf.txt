A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on 2nd Street between Stillman
Street and Bryant Street. As the AV was approaching the intersection with Stillman Street, a blue Model 3 Tesla exited out of a parking
garage into the AV’s lane of travel. The AV braked and, shortly thereafter, the AV made contact with the Model 3 Tesla, damaging the
AV’s front bumper fascia and front passenger side wheel opening molding. The driver of the Model 3 Tesla left the scene without
exchanging information. There were no reported injuries. The driver of the Model 3 Tesla later reported damages.
