On December 22, 2021 at 12:35 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle at Cesar Chavez and Valencia Street.

While traveling in manual mode at approximately 25 MPH on westbound Cesar Chavez, the Waymo AV proceeded through a green light
into the intersection at Valencia Street. A passenger vehicle traveling southbound on Valencia Street with no headlights on entered the same
intersection against the light, making contact with the Waymo AV at approximately 14 MPH. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s
Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained moderate
damage to the passenger side rear quarter panel. The other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information.
