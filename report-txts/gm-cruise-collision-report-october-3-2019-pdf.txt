A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northeast bound on Bryant Street between 11th
and 10th Streets when the Cruise AV yielded to a parallel parking vehicle ahead on the right. Shortly thereafter, a lane-splitting electric
scooterist attempting to change lanes made contact with the left rear corner of the Cruise AV. There were no injuries reported at the scene
by either party and police were not called. The electric scooterist later reported injuries.
