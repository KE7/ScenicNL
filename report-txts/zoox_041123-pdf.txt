A Zoox vehicle in autonomy was proceeding northbound on Kearny Street in stop-and-go traffic through an active construction zone. At the
same time, an e-scooter traveling near the right curb was passing other slow traffic behind the Zoox vehicle. Before the e-scooter could also
pass the Zoox vehicle on the right, the e-scooter weaved away from the curb, seemingly to avoid a drainage grate, and came within a close
following distance behind the Zoox vehicle. As the Zoox vehicle came to a stop again for traffic ahead the e-scooter rider did not stop, and
the e-scooter made contact with the right rear tail light of the Zoox vehicle. The e-scooter rider remained upright, did not stop to exchange
information, and immediately rode off while the Zoox vehicle was still stopped. There were no injuries and police were not called. The
damage to the Zoox vehicle was limited to a cracked tail light lens.
