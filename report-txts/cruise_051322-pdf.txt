A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
westbound Pine Street at the intersection with Franklin Street. A black BMW approaching from the rear made contact with the Cruise AV's
rear bumper, damaging the Cruise AV's rear bumper. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. The two
Cruise AV operators in the Cruise AV later reported back injuries. Police were not called.
