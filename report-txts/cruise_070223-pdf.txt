A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Franklin Street in the
second rightmost lane between Hayes Street and Fell Street. At the same time, a white Kia Forte traveling in the adjacent center lane veered
into the Cruise AV’s lane without a turn signal. Shortly thereafter, contact was made with the Cruise AV’s driver side front and rear

passenger door, damaging the driver side front and rear passenger door of the Cruise AV. The driver of the white Kia Forte left the scene
without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
