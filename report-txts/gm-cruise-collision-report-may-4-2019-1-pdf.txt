A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was approaching the intersection prior to making a left turn
from northbound Larkin Street onto westbound McAllister Street when the Cruise AV slowed down. The driver of the Cruise AV

disengaged from autonomous mode, and shortly thereafter, another vehicle made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging
the Cruise AV’s right rear bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called.
