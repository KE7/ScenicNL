A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Harrison St. between
18th Street and 19th Street. As the Cruise AV was coming to a stop for a stop sign at the intersection with 18th Street, a van approaching
from the rear failed to stop behind the Cruise AV and made contact with the Cruise AV's rear bumper, damaging the rear bumper of the
Cruise AV. Police and Emergency Medical Services were called and the Cruise AV was towed from the scene. The driver of the van was
transported by Emergency Medical Services for further evaluation.
