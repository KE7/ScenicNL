A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in manual mode, was stopped in a legal curbside parking spot on northbound
Leavenworth Street between Francisco Street and Bay Street. A Mazda CX-9 approaching from the rear and traveling northbound on
Leavenworth Street made contact with the Cruise AV’s rear driver side, damaging the left rear quarter panel of the Cruise AV resulting in

the Cruise AV being towed from the incident. There is also damage to the Mazda CX-9’s right front quarter panel. There were no injuries
reported and the police were not called.
