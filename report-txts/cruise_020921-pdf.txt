A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), was in autonomous mode and traveling northbound on De Haro Street between 23rd and 22nd
streets. The AV braked in response to a pedestrian in the middle of the intersection on De Haro, running directly towards the AV. The
AVTO, concerned for their safety, disengaged from autonomous mode to attempt to move the AV around the pedestrian who was still
rapidly heading directly towards the AV in the center of the street. The Cruise AV was then struck by a skateboarder that suddenly entered
the crosswalk from the southeast sidewalk, coming downhill from 22nd street. Contact was made by the skateboarder to the Cruise AV.
This caused damage to the front quarter panel area and the articulating radar of the Cruise AV. Because the skateboarder appeared injured,

911 was immediately called. The skateboarder left the scene shortly after the incident and before the police arrived. The Cruise AVTOs
remained on the scene and gave a statement to the police.
