A Zoox vehicle, operating in conventional mode, was coming to a stop at the Grant Ave. and Union St. intersection and traveling less than
2mph, when it was struck on its front bumper by a bicyclist. The Zoox vehicle was traveling northbound on the one-way street when the
bicyclist turned left from Union St. onto Grant Ave. and rode into the Zoox vehicle. The bicyclist's left turn caused the bicyclist to travel in

the wrong direction on the one-way street. After contact, the cyclist continued traveling southbound (against the one-way) on Grant Ave.
despite attempts to get the bicyclist's attention in order to exchange information.
