A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV’) being driven in conventional mode was involved in a single-car collision on northbound
Clipper Street near the intersection with westbound Portola Drive. While the driver of the Cruise AV began to turn left onto Portola, the

driver made contact with the traffic island, damaging the Cruise AV’s front left wheel assembly. There were no injuries and police were not
called.
