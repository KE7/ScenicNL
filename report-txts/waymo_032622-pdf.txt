On March 26, 2022 at 1:16 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a SUV on Oakdale Avenue and Toland Street.

The Waymo AV was slowing for a stop sign while traveling westbound on Oakdale Avenue in autonomous mode. An SUV approached
from behind and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. The other party immediately left the scene of the event. At the time of the

impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position).
Both vehicles sustained moderate damage.
