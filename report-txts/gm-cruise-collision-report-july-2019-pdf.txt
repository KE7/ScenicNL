A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Grant Street between Clay and
Washington Streets when another vehicle, completing a left turn from Clay onto Grant, made contact with the left rear corner of the Cruise

AV, damaging the left lower tail lamp and rear fascia. The driver of the other vehicle drove away without exchanging information. There
were no injuries and police were not called.
