A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in conventional mode, was making a left turn from southeast bound 11th Street onto
northeast bound Folsom Street when the driver of the Cruise AV made contact with the rear driver side door of another vehicle that was
proceeding through the green light on southwest bound 11th Street, damaging both the other vehicle’s rear driver side door and wheel well
and the Cruise AV’s front left bumper and wheel well. There were no injuries and police were not called.
