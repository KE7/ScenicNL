A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was traveling eastbound on Hayes Street between Scott Street and
Divisadero Street. As the Cruise AV approached the intersection with Divisadero Street, the Cruise AV made contact with the rear bumper
of a 2017 Toyota Prius that was stopped at the intersection. This caused damage to the front bumper of the Cruise AV and the rear bumper

of the 2017 Toyota Prius. No injuries were reported at the scene by either party. A Cruise AV test driver later sought medical evaluation.
