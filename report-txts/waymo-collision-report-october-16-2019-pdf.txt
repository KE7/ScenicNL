A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode on northbound Distel Drive at El Camino Real in Los
Altos when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV was preparing to make a right-on-red from Distel Drive onto eastbound El Camino Real and
was yielding to cross-traffic when a passenger vehicle made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 1 MPH. The

Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its rear bumper, and the passenger vehicle sustained minor damage to its front bumper. No injuries
were reported.
