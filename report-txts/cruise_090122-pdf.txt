A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Pine Street
between Powell Street and Stockton Street. At the same time, a motorcyclist approaching from the rear began to merge into the Cruise
AV's lane behind the Cruise AV, and subsequently made contact with the Cruise AV's rear passenger side bumper, damaging the
motorcycle's front fender. The driver of the motorcycle reported minor injuries and police were not called.
