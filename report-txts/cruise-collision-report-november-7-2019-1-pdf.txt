A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southwest bound on King Street between 2nd
and 3rd Streets when the Cruise AV slowed down. Shortly thereafter, another vehicle, changing into the Cruise AV’s lane from the right
adjacent lane, made contact with the right rear corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right rear fascia and a radar mounting
bracket. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and police were not called.
