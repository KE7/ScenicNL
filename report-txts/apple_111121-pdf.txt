A test vehicle, stopped at a red light in Sunnyvale while operating in manual mode, was lightly struck on a sensor attached to the rear driver
side wheel by a white minivan attempting to maneuver around the vehicle to enter a left turn lane. The test vehicleâ€™s sensor was not

damaged. The minivan left the scene without stopping, so any damage to the minivan is unknown. No injuries were reported, and law
enforcement was not called to the scene.
