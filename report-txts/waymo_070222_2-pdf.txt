On July 2, 2022 at 11:23 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger car on Bayshore Boulevard at Jerrold Avenue.

The Waymo AV was traveling north on Bayshore Boulevard in the rightmost lane when a passenger car approached the Waymo AV from
behind on the left. Just after passing the Waymo AV, the passenger car veered across the path of the Waymo AV into the entrance of a gas

station on the right hand side of the roadway. The right rear corner of the passenger vehicle made contact with the front left corner of the
Waymo AV, immediately after which the passenger car left the scene.

At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode.
