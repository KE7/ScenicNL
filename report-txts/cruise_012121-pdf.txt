A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling Southwest on Minna Street between Sth Street
and Mary Street. A white Mazda pulled out from a construction area without yielding, onto Minna Street. Seeing that the Mazda was not
going to yield to oncoming traffic, the AVTO disengaged from autonomous mode and unsuccessfully attempted to avoid collision. The

Mazda made contact with the Cruise AV causing damage to the front driver side bumper and fender of the Cruise AV. There were no
injuries and the police were not called.
