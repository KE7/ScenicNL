On August 19, 2023 at 4:45 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger car on 13th Street at Mission Street.

The Waymo AV entered the slip lane which connects westbound 13th Street to northbound Mission Street and came to a stop to yield to
cross-traffic on Mission Street. As the Waymo AV was stopped, the front of the passenger car which was traveling behind the Waymo AV
made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode,
and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained damage.
