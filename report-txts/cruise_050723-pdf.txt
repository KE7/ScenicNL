A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in manual mode, was traveling northbound on Polk Street between Pine Street and
California Street. As the Cruise AV was passing through the intersection with California Street on a green light, a stand-up scooterist
traveling eastbound on California Street entered the intersection on a red light and shortly thereafter made contact with the Cruise AV,

damaging the Cruise AV’s front and rear driver side doors, front driver side radar assembly and rear driver side door handle. The scooterist
left the scene without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
