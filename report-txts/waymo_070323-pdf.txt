On July 3, 2023 at 1:13 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (““Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger car on Hampshire Street at 21st Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling southbound on Hampshire Street in autonomous mode when it began to brake as it approached a stopped van
on the oncoming side of the narrow roadway. The Waymo AV test driver transitioned to manual mode and began proceeding straight when
the passenger side front sensor housing of the Waymo AV made contact with the driver side mirror of a passenger car parked along the curb
on southbound Hampshire Street. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating
the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both the Waymo AV and the passenger car sustained damage.
