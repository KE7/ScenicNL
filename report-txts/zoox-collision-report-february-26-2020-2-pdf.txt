A Zoox vehicle was stationary in autonomous mode on Montgomery St facing north towards Broadway St, yielding for an oncoming bus

encroaching upon its lane. The bus struck the driver's side mirror, causing it to fold with minor damage. The bus driver did not stop, so no
information was exchanged. There were no injuries and police were not called.
