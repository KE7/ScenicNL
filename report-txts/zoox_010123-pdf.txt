A Zoox vehicle in autonomous mode was proceeding straight in its lane on Mason Street in San Francisco, CA when an occupant of a
parallel parked car (Vehicle 2) abruptly opened its rear passenger side door into the side of the Zoox vehicle, causing minor damage to both
vehicles. The Zoox operator disengaged as a result of the contact. There were no injuries and the police were not called.
