A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) in autonomous mode was yielding to check for cross traffic while in the slip lane to turn
from southbound Shoreline Boulevard to westbound El Camino Real in Mountain View when it was rear-ended by a passenger vehicle at
approximately 5 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its rear bumper, and the passenger vehicle had minor damage to its
front bumper. The two Waymo AV operators reported neck/back pain but declined medical attention at the scene.
