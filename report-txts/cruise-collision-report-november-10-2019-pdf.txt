A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) was involved in a collision while parked in conventional mode on the westbound side of
Vallejo Street near the intersection with Polk Street. While the Cruise AV was parked parallel to the curb on the street, another vehicle
traveling westbound on Vallejo in the left adjacent traffic lane sideswiped and made contact with the left side of the Cruise AV and the
parked vehicle in front of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s driver’s side mirror, camera, articulating radar assembly, and doors.
The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and police were not called.
