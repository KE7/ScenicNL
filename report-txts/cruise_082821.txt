A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Steiner Street between
McAllister Street and Fulton Street. The Cruise AV was traveling 24.4 mph upon entering the intersection with Fulton Street on a green
light. As the Cruise AV continued through the intersection, a bicyclist traveling eastbound on Fulton Street failed to stop for their red light
and entered the intersection. The Cruise AV was disengaged from autonomous mode and the Cruise AV operator braked to a speed of 8.7
mph and, shortly thereafter, the bicyclist made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the front of the Cruise AV and the bicycle. The cyclist
verbally reported they were okay. However, the Cruise AV Operator noticed minor injuries to the cyclict. Police and Emergency Medical
Services were called, but the cyclist left the scene before the police or EMS arrived.
