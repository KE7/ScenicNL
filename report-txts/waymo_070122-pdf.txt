On July 1, 2022 at 10:08 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a van in a parking lot near Bayshore Boulevard at Flower Street.

The Waymo AV came to a stop while yielding for an oncoming van in a narrow passageway in a parking lot. While attempting to pass the
Waymo AV, the van made contact with the sensor housing on the left rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s

Level 4 ADS was stationary and engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles
sustained minor damage.
