A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode in the slip lane from westbound Nita Avenue to
northbound San Antonio Road in Palo Alto when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV was yielding to approaching traffic when a
commercial box truck made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 3 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage

to its rear bumper, and the commercial box truck left without exchanging information. Waymo contacted the Palo Alto Police Department
and a police report was filed. No injuries were reported at the scene.
