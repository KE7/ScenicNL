On May 3, 2023 at 10:32 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving an SUV on Pine Street near Broderick Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling in autonomous mode in the middle lane on westbound Pine Street between Divisadero Street and Broderick
Street. A slower traveling van in the left adjacent lane began to initiate a right lane change in front of the Waymo AV, and the Waymo AV
test driver transitioned to manual mode and braked. The SUV traveling behind the Waymo AV then made contact with the rear of the

Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in
manual mode. The Waymo AV and SUV sustained damage.
