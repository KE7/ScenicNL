On May 4, 2022 at 1:26 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle at the northbound merge lane on the 100 block of Bayshore Boulevard.

While attempting a merge onto northbound Bayshore Boulevard from southbound Bayshore Boulevard, the Waymo AV came to a stop to
yield for approaching traffic on the right. While stopped, a vehicle approached from behind and made contact with the rear bumper of the
Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in
the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
