On April 29, 2022 at 6:37 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a pickup truck on Sacramento Street at Polk Street.

The Waymo AV was proceeding straight in manual in the left lane of Sacramento Street (a one-way street). After passing through the Polk
Street intersection, a parked pickup truck on the left side of Sacramento Street pulled out of the parked position and made contact with the
front left fender of the passing Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was
operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
