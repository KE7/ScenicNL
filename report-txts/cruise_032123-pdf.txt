A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Clay Street between
Hyde Street and Leavenworth Street. Shortly before the intersection with Leavenworth Street, the Cruise AV made contact with a downed

power cable on Clay Street and came to a stop. This caused damage to the Cruise AVâ€™s front driver side radar assembly. There were no
injuries.
