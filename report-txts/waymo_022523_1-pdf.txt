On February 25th, 2023 at 7:23 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a heavy truck on 25th Street at Noe Street.

The Waymo AV was proceeding East on 25th Street near the intersection with Noe Street when it came to a stop to yield to a heavy truck
traveling West on 25th Street. As the heavy truck moved past the Waymo AV, the front left tire of the heavy truck made contact with the
rear left sensor of the Waymo AV. The heavy truck then left the scene. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was
engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage.
