A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in autonomous mode at the intersection of Brannan Street and Division
Street in San Francisco when it was involved in a collision. The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic for a red traffic light on southbound
Brannan Street at Division Street when a passenger vehicle behind the Waymo AV made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at
approximately less than 1 MPH. The Waymo AV was stationary. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its rear bumper, and the
passenger vehicle left the scene before exchanging information. No injuries were reported at the scene.
