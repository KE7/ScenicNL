On March 16, 2023 at 5:10 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger car on Bayshore Boulevard between Flower Street and Cortland Avenue.

The Waymo AV was traveling north on Bayshore Boulevard in autonomous mode, merging into the rightmost lane. As the Waymo AV
merged, the test driver transitioned from autonomous mode to manual mode and began accelerating. The front of the Waymo AV made
contact with the rear of a passenger car that was stopped in the rightmost lane. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS

was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both the Waymo AV and the passenger car sustained
damage.
