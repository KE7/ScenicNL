A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Folsom Street between
8th Street and Langton Street. As the Cruise AV approached the intersection with Langton Street, the Cruise AV traveled over a pothole,
which blew out the front driver side tire and caused the Cruise AV to veer into the adjacent parking lane. Shortly thereafter, the Cruise AV
made contact with a parked Subaru Impreza, causing damage to the Cruise AV’s front passenger side quarter panel, front passenger side
fascia, front driver side tire and rear passenger side quarter panel. Police and Emergency Medical Services were called and the Cruise AV

was towed from the scene. The passenger of the Cruise AV was assessed by medical personnel at the scene but was not transported by
Emergency Medical Services.
