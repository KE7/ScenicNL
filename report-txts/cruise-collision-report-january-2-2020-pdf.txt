A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) being driven in conventional mode was involved in a collision on eastbound Clement Street
between 24th and 25th Avenues. While the Cruise AV was parked parallel to the curb on the street, another vehicle reversing out of its

parallel parking spot made contact with the front bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s front center radar bracket assembly.
There were no injuries and police were not called.
