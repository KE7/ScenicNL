A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on 25th Avenue between
Clement Street and Geary Boulevard. The Cruise AV entered the intersection with Geary Boulevard on a green light. As the Cruise AV was
passing through the intersection, a Mercedes Sedan traveling eastbound on Geary Boulevard entered the intersection on a red light and
shortly thereafter made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the front right quarter of the Cruise AV. The Mercedes Sedan then made
contact with a nearby building, resulting in damage to the property. Police and Emergency Medical Services were called to the scene. The

Cruise AV was towed from the scene. Occupants of the Mercedes Sedan received medical treatment at the scene and were not transported
by Emergency Medical Services.
