A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southeast bound on Sickles Avenue toward the
intersection with Mission Street in the left turn lane; when the Cruise AV yielded to another vehicle that encroached into the Cruise AV’s
lane from the right adjacent lane. Shortly thereafter, a second vehicle made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the

Cruise AV’s rear impact bar and a radar mounting bracket and the other vehicle’s front bumper. There were no injuries and police were not
called.
