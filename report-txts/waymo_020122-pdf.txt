On February 2, 2022 at 8:44 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a SUV on Clipper Street and Noe Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped at a stop sign facing west on Clipper Street in autonomous mode while yielding to pedestrians in the
crosswalk. After the pedestrians had crossed, the Waymo started to edge forward when an SUV to the Waymo AV’s rear passed the Waymo
AV by driving in the oncoming traffic lane and made contact with the left rear sensor housing of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact,

the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The
Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
