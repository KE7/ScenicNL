A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in autonomous mode in the far right lane on southbound Highway 85
passing E] Camino Real in Mountain View. A passenger vehicle entered the highway from El Camino Real and made an unsafe maneuver
by crossing over a solid white line and cutting-in to the Waymo AV’s lane. Out of an abundance of caution, the Waymo AV’s test driver
disengaged the autonomous mode on the Waymo AV and made an evasive maneuver into the left adjacent lane at approximately 45 MPH.
As the test driver made the maneuver, the Waymo AV came into contact with a second passenger vehicle that had been approaching from
behind in the left adjacent lane. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage and tire marks to the driver side of the vehicle, and the second
passenger vehicle sustained no damage. The driver of the second passenger vehicle stopped to exchange information with the Waymo test
