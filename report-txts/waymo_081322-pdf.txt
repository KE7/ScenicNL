On August 13, 2022 at 03:09 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving an SUV on 14th Street at Noe Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling eastbound on 14th Street in autonomous mode when it slowed for a stop sign on Noe Street. As the Waymo
AV slowed to almost a complete stop, an SUV made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. Both vehicles sustained damage.

At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s
seating position).
