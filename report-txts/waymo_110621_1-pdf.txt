On November 6, 2021 at 1:50 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle at Waller Street at Alpine Terrace.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on Waller Street when it yielded to an oncoming passenger vehicle. As the passenger vehicle
passed the stopped Waymo AV, its driver side rearview mirror made contact with a Waymo AV sensor. At the time of the impact, the

Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles
sustained minor damage.
