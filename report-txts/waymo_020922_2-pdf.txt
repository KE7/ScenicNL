On February 9, 2022 at 5:46 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a bicyclist on Parker Avenue at McAllister Street.

The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode and traveling southbound on Parker Avenue when it came to a stop at McAllister Street. As the
Waymo AV proceeded, a bicyclist traveling northbound on Parker Avenue proceeded through the stop sign without stopping in order to
make a left turn onto westbound McAllister Street. The Waymo AV began to brake and the test driver (in the driver’s seating position),
disengaged the AV system and continued braking. As the bicyclist attempted to complete their left turn, the bicyclist made contact with the
driver side rear corner of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was
operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo sustained damage.
