On July 2, 2022 at 6:54 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger car on the Embarcadero at Broadway.

The Waymo AV was stopped in the dedicated left turn lane facing north on the Embarcadero, awaiting a green signal for a protected left
turn onto Broadway. The signal for traffic proceeding north on the Embarcadero turned green, and traffic in adjacent lanes began moving.
The left turn arrow signal for the dedicated turn lane occupied by the Waymo AV remained red. The passenger car that had been stopped

directly behind the Waymo AV began moving forward. The front of the passenger car made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV,
immediately after which the passenger car left the scene.
