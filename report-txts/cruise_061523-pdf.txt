A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Sacramento Street
between Lyon Street and Baker Street. The Cruise AV approached a motorized articulating boom lift (““ABL”), which was stopped in the
Cruise AV’s lane of travel. As the Cruise AV began to maneuver around and to the left of the ABL, the Cruise AV made contact with the

arm of the ABL, which was elevated above the roadway. This caused damage to the Cruise AV’s roof Lidar assembly. There were no
reported injuries.
