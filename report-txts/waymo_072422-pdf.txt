On July 24, 2022 at 11:16 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a van on Connecticut Street north of 25th Street.

While proceeding northwest on Connecticut Street in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV came to a stop behind a stalled bus blocking the
roadway. The driver transitioned the system to manual mode and began to reverse out of the narrow road. While reversing, a van
approached from behind and the Waymo AV made contact with the front left fender of the van. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s
Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
