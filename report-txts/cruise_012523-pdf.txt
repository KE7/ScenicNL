A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in manual mode, was traveling northbound on 13th Street in the rightmost lane
between Folsom Street and South Van Ness Avenue. At the same time, a Model 3 Tesla traveling in the adjacent center lane alongside the
Cruise AV attempted to change lanes in front of the Cruise AV over a solid white line into the rightmost lane in which the Cruise AV was
traveling. During this maneuver, the Model 3 Tesla made contact with the Cruise AV’s driver side rear wheel and wheel well, and driver

side rear passenger door, damaging the Tesla’s front passenger side wheel well . The parties exchanged information and there were no
reported injuries.
