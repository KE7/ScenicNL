On July 12, 2021 at 3:10 PM PDT, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was in a collision involving a van at Broadway and
Gough Street in San Francisco. The Waymo AV, while in autonomous mode, was waiting to make a left turn and yielding to oncoming
traffic, when the test driver (in the driver’s seating position) transitioned to manual mode and proceeded with a left turn manually. During
the left turn, an approaching van struck the right side of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV was in manual mode.
