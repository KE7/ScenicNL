On February 19, 2022 at 7:45 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle at the northbound merge lane on the 100 block of Bayshore Boulevard.

While attempting a merge onto northbound Bayshore Boulevard from southbound Bayshore Boulevard, the Waymo AV came to a stop to
yield for approaching traffic on the right. While stopped, a vehicle approached from behind and made contact with the rear bumper of the
Waymo AV. The other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS
was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
