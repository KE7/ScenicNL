A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) traveling eastbound in reverse on Eugenia Avenue at Elsie Street in San Francisco was
involved in a collision. While in manual mode, the Waymo AV test driver was backing up on a narrow street in order to make room for an
oncoming passenger vehicle to pass. As the Waymo AV test driver reversed, the Waymo AV’s rear passenger’s side sensor housing came in
contact with an unoccupied parked passenger vehicle’s driver’s side rear fender. The Waymo AV was traveling approximately 1 MPH. The

Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its rear passenger’s side sensor housing, and the unoccupied parked passenger vehicle’s sustained
minor damage to its driver’s side rear fender. No injuries were reported at the scene.
