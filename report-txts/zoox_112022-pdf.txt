A Zoox vehicle in autonomy was stopped at a red light waiting for traffic ahead on Embarcadero with brake lights illuminated. When the
traffic light changed to green, surrounding traffic began to move. The Zoox vehicle appropriately continued to wait for a stopped lead
vehicle immediately ahead when vehicle 2 struck the Zoox vehicle from the rear. Zoox vehicle camera footage shows the driver of vehicle 2
holding their cellphone raised in their hand at the time of contact. There were no injuries and police were not called.
