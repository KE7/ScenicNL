On April 11,2019 at approximately 11:31 am, a Lyft Autonomous Vehicle operating in manual mode was involved in an incident with a
moving third party vehicle. The incident occurred after making a right turn from Natoma Street and 6th Street in San Francisco, CA. Lyft
was proceeding straight in the right lane when the third party vehicle aggressively swerved into the right lane, cutting broadside in front of
the Lyft AV, and came to a complete stop, causing unavoidable impact from the Lyft AV at approximately 1 mph. The Lyft AV sustained
damage to the front left bumper, fender, and left lidar sensor. The third party vehicle sustained damage to the right rear quarter panel and

rear passenger door. Lyft AV operators called 911 due to hostile behavior of the third party driver and emergency vehicles responded to the
scene. No injuries were reported by the first responders or the team in the Lyft AV.
