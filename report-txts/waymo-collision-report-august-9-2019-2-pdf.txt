A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode on southbound N. Shoreline Boulevard at W.
Middlefield Road in Mountain View when a bicyclist made contact with the side of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV was traveling in the
far right lane on N. Shoreline Boulevard and slowing for a red light at W. Middlefield Road, when a bicyclist began to cross all lanes of
traffic from the east side of N. Shoreline Boulevard to the west side of the boulevard, in a diagonal manner, against the flow of traffic. As
the bicyclist approached the Waymo AV, the Waymo AV began braking for the bicyclist. As the Waymo AV came to a stop, the bicyclist
then made contact with the driver’s side rear quarter panel of the Waymo AV at approximately 8 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor

scratches to the driver’s side rear taillight, and the bicyclist, remaining upright, appeared to sustain no damage or injuries as they cycled
away from the scene without exchanging information.
