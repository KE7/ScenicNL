On January 20, 2022 at 2:24 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on Polk Street at Sacramento Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped at a red light facing north on Polk Street in autonomous mode at the Sacramento Street intersection. The light
turned green and the Waymo AV proceeded partially into the intersection, yielding to pedestrians in the left crosswalk while preparing to
make a left turn. A passenger vehicle parked behind the Waymo AV on the right shoulder of Sacramento street pulled out of the shoulder
and made contact with the right side of the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged
in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
