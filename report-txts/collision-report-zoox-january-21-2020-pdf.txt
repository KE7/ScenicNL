A Zoox vehicle was traveling in manual mode on 3rd St. towards Mission St. when a car merged into the lane behind it. While the Zoox
vehicle yielded to a bus, the car behind the Zoox vehicle made contact with the Zoox vehicle's rear bumper, damaging some sensors. The

Zoox vehicle driver pulled over to assess the damage and exchange driver information but the other vehicle did not stop. There were no
injuries and police were not called.
