A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Clement Street. As the Cruise
AV was in the intersection with 26th Avenue, a blue Toyota Matrix traveling northbound on 26th Avenue failed to yield and entered the
intersection. The Toyota made contact with the Cruise AV's front left bumper and damaged the bumper wheel and the wheel cover. After

the incident, the passenger in the Cruise AV reported minor shoulder soreness. There were no additional injuries reported and police were
not called.
