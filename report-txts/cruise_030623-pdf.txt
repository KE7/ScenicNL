A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
northbound Polk Street at the intersection with Sutter Street. The Cruise AV began to proceed as the light turned green when an Infiniti Q50
passed the Cruise AV in the oncoming traffic lane and began performing “donuts” in the intersection. The Cruise AV began to initiate a left
turn onto Sutter Street when the Infiniti Q50 made contact with the Cruise AV’s front driver side bumper, causing damage to the front
driver side bumper, front driver side fascia and front driver side headlight. The driver of the Infiniti Q50 left the scene without exchanging
information. There were no reported injuries and the Cruise AV was towed from the incident.
