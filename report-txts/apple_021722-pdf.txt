On February 17th, a test vehicle operating in manual mode was traveling North-bound on Charles Road in Sunnyvale when the test vehicle's

passenger-side mirror clipped the driver-side mirror of a parked Ford F-150, causing cosmetic damage to both mirror housings. No injuries
were reported and law enforcement was not called to the scene.
