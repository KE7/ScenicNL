A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was turning from northbound Stanyan St. to westbound on
Parnassus Street. As the Cruise AV was starting to turn, a black GMC Denali behind the Cruise AV attempted to overtake the Cruise AV
causing the AVTO to disengage from autonomous mode. The GMC Denali made contact with the front driver side bumper of the Cruise

AV, which caused minor damage to the front bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called. The driver of the GMC Denali did
not stop after the incident and could not be contacted.
