On November 3, 2022 at 4:30 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a parked SUV near 101 Villa Terrace.

While reversing in manual on a narrow road, the front right radar of the Waymo AV made contact with the taillight of a parked SUV. At the

time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both
vehicles sustained damage.
