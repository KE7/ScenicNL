On August 2, 2023 at 10:09 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving an SUV on Bush Street at Polk Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped at a red light on eastbound Bush Street at Polk Street. Shortly after the traffic light turned green and the
Waymo AV began to proceed forward, the Waymo AV slowed to a stop. The SUV that was traveling closely behind the Waymo AV made
contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both

vehicles sustained damage, and the trailing SUV left the scene without exchanging information. A passenger in the Waymo AV reported
injuries.
