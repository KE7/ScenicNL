A Zoox vehicle in manual mode was proceeding southbound in the turn lane on Sixth Street with a green light, yielding to a pedestrian
before completing a right turn onto eastbound Harrison Street, in San Francisco, CA with turn signals illuminated. A large truck in the left
adjacent lane abruptly turned right and cut in front of the Zoox vehicle making contact with the left front sensor. There were no injuries, the
other vehicle did not stop to exchange information, and police were not called.
