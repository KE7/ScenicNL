An Argo AI Autonomous Vehicle ("Argo AV") was impacted by a cyclist while traveling east on Park Ave and approaching Cambridge
Ave. The Argo AV was traveling in its lane adjacent to a cyclist who was traveling in a marked bike lane. As the Argo AV was passing the
cyclist (while maintaining more than 2 meters of lateral margin), the cyclist veered left into the Argo AV's lane. In response, the Argo

AV steered away from the cyclist, but the cyclist continued into the lane and the bicycle's left handlebar made contact with the Argo

AV's passenger side door handle. The Test Specialist brought the AV to a stop. The cyclist maintained balance, continued to cross

the lanes behind the stopped Argo AV, and left the scene after a brief conversation with the left seat Test Specialist, during which the
cyclist indicated that he was fine and apologized. The Argo AV sustained minor damage to its passenger side door handle.
