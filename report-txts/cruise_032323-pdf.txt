A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling on westbound Haight Street between
Ashbury Street and Masonic Avenue. At the same time, a San Francisco Municipal Railway (“MUNI”) Bus stopped ahead of the Cruise
AV. Shortly thereafter, the Cruise AV made contact with the rear bumper of the MUNI Bus, damaging the front fascia and front fender of
the Cruise AV. The parties exchanged information. There were no reported injuries and the Cruise AV was towed from the scene.
