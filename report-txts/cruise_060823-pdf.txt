A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Revere Avenue
between Industrial Street and Selby Street. The Cruise AV came to a stop behind a GMC Yukon that was stopped diagonally in the Cruise
AV’s lane of travel. After the Cruise AV came to a complete stop, the GMC Yukon began reversing further into the Cruise AV’s lane and

made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the front bumper fascia of the Cruise AV. The parties exchanged information and there were
no reported injuries.
