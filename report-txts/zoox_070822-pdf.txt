A Zoox vehicle in manual mode was proceeding straight on a one-way street when a passenger vehicle in the right adjacent lane abruptly
cut in front of the Zoox vehicle to make a left turn. The passenger vehicle impacted the front right sensors on the Zoox vehicle and

proceeded left through the intersection. The passenger vehicle drove away without exchanging information. There were no injuries and the
police were not called.
