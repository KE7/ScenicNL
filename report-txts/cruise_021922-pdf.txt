A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on Geary
Boulevard at the intersection with Larkin Street. The Cruise AV began to make a right turn onto Larkin Street on a green light and was
yielding to a pedestrian in the crosswalk. Shortly thereafter, a Toyota Camry traveling in a non-turn lane of Geary Boulevard made a right
turn in front of the Cruise AV, making contact with the Cruise AV's front left bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called.
