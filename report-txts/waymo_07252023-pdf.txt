On July 25, 2023 at 3:04 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a pickup truck on Harrison Street at 2nd Street.

The Waymo AV was parallel parked along the curb on eastbound Harrison Street at 2nd Street when it began to pull away from the curb and
into traffic. As the Waymo AV pulled away from the curb, a pickup truck that was traveling behind the Waymo AV then made contact with
the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver
was present (in the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles sustained damage.
