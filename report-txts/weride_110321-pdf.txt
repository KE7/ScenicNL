At 3:27 PM on 11/03/2021, a driver from Weride was operating one of our autonomous vehicles in autonomous mode on the on-ramp to CA
87 S from Charcot Avenue in North San Jose. Our car was in the queue of traffic waiting for the metering light. While our car was
stationary (0 MPH), the other car involved accelerated slightly to about 5 MPH, which resulted in a minor rear end collision. Our driver and
the other party pulled over onto the shoulder. There were no injuries and information was exchanged. Since damage to our car was
minimal, it was driven back to the office in manual mode.
