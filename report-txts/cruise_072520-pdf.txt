A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) being driven in conventional mode was involved in a single-car collision on westbound
Taraval Street near the intersection with 21st Avenue. After completing a right turn onto Taraval from 21st, the driver of the Cruise AV

turned into a parallel parking space and made contact with the curb, damaging the Cruise AV’s front right tire. There were no injuries and
police were not called.
