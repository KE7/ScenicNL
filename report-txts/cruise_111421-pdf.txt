southbound 4th Avenue at the intersection with Geary Boulevard. Another vehicle approaching from the rear made contact with the Cruise

AV's rear bumper, damaging the rear bumper. The driver of the other vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no
injuries and police were not called.
