A Cruise autonomous vehicle (â€œCruise AV), operating in autonomous mode, was yielding to oncoming traffic prior to making a left turn
onto eastbound 17th Street from southbound Potrero Avenue when another vehicle made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV,
damaging the Cruise AV's right rear bumper bar and fascia. The Cruise AV test operator in the driver's seat reported back pain at the scene

but did not request emergency assistance. The Cruise AV test operator sitting in the front passenger seat did not report any injuries at the
scene, but later reported neck pain. Police were not called.
