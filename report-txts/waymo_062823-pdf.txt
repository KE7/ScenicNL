On June 28, 2023 at 9:19 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a pickup truck on Great Highway near Kirkham Street.

The Waymo AV was parallel parked along the curb on southbound Great Highway when a pickup truck that was initially parked directly
behind the Waymo AV began to maneuver out of its parking spot. As the pickup truck pulled out of the parking spot, it initiated a multi-turn
maneuver and reversed into the parked Waymo AV. The rear passenger's side corner of the pickup truck made contact with the driver side

rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV
sustained damage.
