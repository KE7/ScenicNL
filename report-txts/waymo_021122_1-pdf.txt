On February 11, 2022 at 2:07 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle on Silver Avenue at Mission Street.

After making a right turn onto southbound Silver Avenue from Mission Street in manual mode, the test driver of the Waymo AV pulled
over to the right shoulder of Silver Avenue while waiting for emergency vehicles to pass. A moment later, a passenger vehicle turned right
onto Silver Avenue from Mission Street into the oncoming traffic lane and swerved into the driver door of the Waymo AV. At the time of
the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both vehicles
sustained major damage. The driver of the other vehicle was transported from the scene by first responders with injuries.
