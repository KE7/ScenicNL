A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in manual mode westbound on Euclid Avenue in San Francisco when it was
involved in a collision. The test driver failed to properly navigate a roundabout median at Collins Street and made contact with it at

approximately 28 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained moderate damage to its front bumper and undercarriage, and the median sustained minor
damage. No injuries were reported at the scene.
