On August 25, 2022 at 6:05 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a van on 15th Street at Albion Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling west on 15th street and came to a stop behind a double-parked vehicle in the right lane. Shortly after coming
to a stop, a van approached from behind and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. The van then changed lanes and left the scene.

At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s
seating position). The Waymo AV sustained moderate damage.
