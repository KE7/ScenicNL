A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Leavenworth Street at the
intersection with Post Street when the Cruise AV yielded to a public transit bus changing into the Cruise AV’s lane from the right adjacent
lane. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, another vehicle made contact with the left rear

corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s left rear fascia and the other vehicle’s right front fascia. There were no injuries and
police were not called.
