A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
36th Avenue at the intersection with Lincoln Way. The Cruise AV began to make a left turn onto Lincoln Way after the light turned green.
While the Cruise AV was in the intersection completing the turn, the Cruise AV operator disengaged from autonomous into manual mode.
After the disengagement, the Cruise AV operator continued straight forward, and shortly thereafter, made contact with the right curb and
concrete guardrail on Lincoln Way. This caused damage to the Cruise AVâ€™s front passenger side bumper and front passenger side fascia.
The Cruise AV operator reported injuries and the Cruise AV was towed from the incident.
