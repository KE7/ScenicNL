On May 21, 2022 at 10:03 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving an SUV on Coleridge Street at Coso Avenue.

The Waymo AV was parked on the right side of the road, facing northbound Coleridge Street. An SUV passed the Waymo AV in the traffic
lane to the left of the Waymo AV and began shifting to the right as it approached Coso Avenue. The right side of the SUV made contact
with the front left sensor of the stationary Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test
driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
