A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (““Waymo AV”) was stopped in manual mode in the sliplane from southbound Page Mill Road to
northbound Oregon Expressway in Palo Alto when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV test driver was yielding to approaching traffic when
a passenger vehicle made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 12 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage
to its rear bumper, and the passenger vehicle sustained minor damage to its front bumper. The Waymo AV test driver and co-driver both
reported head and neck pain, but declined medical treatment at the scene. No other injuries were reported.
