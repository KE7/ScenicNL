On September 17, 2021 at 11:39 AM PDT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (““Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on the 400 block of Washington Street. While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV was stopped
behind a double-parked passenger vehicle in the right-hand lane of traffic with slow-moving (same directional) traffic to its left. The driver
of the Waymo AV transitioned the vehicle to manual mode and initiated a lane change into the congested left-hand lane. Before the driver

of the Waymo AV could complete this maneuver, the passenger vehicle in front of the Waymo AV shifted into reverse and proceeded to
make contact with the rear right sensor of the Waymo AV. Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
