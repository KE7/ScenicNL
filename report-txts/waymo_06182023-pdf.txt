On June 18, 2023 at 5:06 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle on Market Street and Diamond Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped for a red light on Market Street at Diamond Street with its turn signal activated to indicate intent to turn left
onto Diamond Street. The traffic light turned green, and the Waymo AV slowly moved forward, yielding to oncoming traffic, when the
vehicle that had been previously stopped behind the Waymo AV proceeded forward, making contact with the rear bumper of the Waymo

AV. The other party immediately left the scene of the event. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in
autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage.
