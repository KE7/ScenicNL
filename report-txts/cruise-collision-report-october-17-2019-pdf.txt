A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was stopped at a red light on southbound Hyde Street at the
intersection with Sutter Street when another vehicle behind the Cruise AV attempted to change into the right adjacent lane and made contact

with the right rear corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right rear radar and assembly. There were no injuries and police
were not called.
