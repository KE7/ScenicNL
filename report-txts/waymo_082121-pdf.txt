A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco was in a collision involving a vehicle at Scott Street and
Sacramento Street. While operating in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV was stopped at a stop sign intersection yielding to a pedestrian in
the crosswalk as a passenger vehicle arrived at the intersection from the left. Once the pedestrian cleared the crosswalk, the Waymo AV
started to proceed at the same time as the passenger vehicle to the left. The driver of the Waymo AV transitioned into manual mode,

bringing the vehicle to a stop and the passenger vehicle behind the AV accelerated into the rear of the Waymo vehicle. The Waymo AV
sustained minor damage to the rear bumper.
