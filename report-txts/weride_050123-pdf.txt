On Monday May Ist at 11:41am a Weride autonomous vehicle (Vehicle 1) was in Autonomous Mode stopped at the intersection of Bay St
towards Columbus Ave appropriately yielding to a illegally U turning skateboard on Bay St North to South direction in front of the AV
(Vehicle 1). While yielding, a bicyclist was coming from behind our AV (Vehicle 1) head was turned left possibly looking for cross traffic.
When the cyclist turned his head forward, it was too late to react in time to our stopped vehicle(Vehicle 1) with the given distance and speed
they were traveling at in which the cyclist collided with our vehicle (Vehicle 1). Our Weride safety officer immediately disengaged and
hand signaled to the bicyclist to pull over to the closest safe place to park as to not obstruct traffic. As our safety officer parked and got out

of the car to check on the bicyclist, the bicyclist was already on in motion on his bicycle and "fist bumped" our safety officer while passing
by him and leaving the scene without exchanging any information.
