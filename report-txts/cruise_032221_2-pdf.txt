A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was traveling westbound in the leftmost lane on Sacramento Street
between Larkin Street and Polk Street. As the Cruise AV operator attempted to parallel park behind a Hyundai Tucson, the Cruise AV made

contact with the Hyundai Tucson. The parties exchanged information. There were no damages to the Cruise AV and there were no reported
injuries.
