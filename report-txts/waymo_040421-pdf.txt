A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) traveling northbound on Jones Street approaching Clay Street in San Francisco was
involved in a collision. After the Waymo AV made a right turn from Pleasant Street in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV test driver
disengaged autonomous mode to maneuver past an oncoming vehicle on Jones Street that was drifting toward the Waymo AV. While in
manual mode, the Waymo AV’s passenger side view mirror then made contact with an unoccupied parked passenger vehicle’s driver side
view mirror at approximately 6 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its passenger side view mirror. The unoccupied
passenger vehicle’s driver-side mirror was cracked, but most or all of the damage appeared to have been pre-existing. No other damage was
observed to the unoccupied passenger vehicle. No injuries were reported at the scene.
