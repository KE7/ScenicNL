A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was making a left turn from the leftmost lane on westbound
Bush Street onto northbound Octavia Street when the Cruise AV slowed down. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous
mode and, shortly thereafter, another vehicle clipped the Cruise AV’s right rear corner, damaging the right rear bumper cover, wheel well,

and wheel. The driver of the other vehicle drove away without exchanging information. There were no injuries. Police were called but not
dispatched to the scene.
