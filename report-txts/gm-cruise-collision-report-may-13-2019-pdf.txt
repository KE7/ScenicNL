A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling straight through a green light northbound on
Fillmore Street at the intersection with Fell Street when another vehicle, traveling westbound and violating a red light on Fell Street, came
into the Cruise AV’s path. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode, and thereafter, the Cruise AV and the other

vehicle made contact, damaging the other vehicle’s left rear door and the Cruise AV’s front bumper assembly, grill, and both front wheel
wells. There were no injuries and police were not called.
