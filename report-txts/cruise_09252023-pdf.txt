A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("AV"), operating in manual mode, was traveling northbound on 25th Avenue between California Street and
Clement Street. The AV operator improperly engaged from manual into autonomous mode while the AV was in motion, temporarily
causing the AV to steer to the right. The AV operator then disengaged from autonomous mode into manual mode, and shortly thereafter, the
AV made contact with an unoccupied and parked red Chrysler Voyager. This caused damage to the AVâ€™s front passenger side bumper
fascia. The AV operator left contact information for the other party and there were no reported injuries.
