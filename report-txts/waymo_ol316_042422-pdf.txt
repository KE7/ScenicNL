On April 24, 2022 at 4:36 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving an SUV on Lincoln Way at 17th Avenue.

The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode and traveling on westbound Lincoln Way, when it slowed for the vehicle directly in front of the
Waymo AV, which stopped shortly after passing 17th Avenue. Shortly after the Waymo AV came to a stop, the SUV behind the Waymo
AV was rear-ended by a pickup truck, and the SUV then made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the

Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles
sustained minor damage.
