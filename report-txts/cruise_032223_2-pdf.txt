A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Shafter Avenue
between Ingalls Street and Hawes Street. Shortly after the intersection with Ingalls Street, the Cruise AV made contact with a tow dolly

attached to the back of a double-parked truck, damaging the front passenger side bumper and front passenger side fender of the Cruise AV.
There were no reported injuries.
