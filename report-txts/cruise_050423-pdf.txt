A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Franklin Street
between Clay Street and Sacramento Street. As the Cruise AV passed through the intersection with Sacramento Street, a scooterist
approaching from the rear merged into the Cruise AV's lane behind the Cruise AV. The Cruise AV began to brake, and the scooterist made
contact with the rear window and rear bumper of the Cruise AV. This caused damage to the rear window, rear bumper and driver side rear

headlight of the Cruise AV. The parties exchanged information. There were no injuries reported at the scene and police were not called. The
scooterist later reported injuries.
