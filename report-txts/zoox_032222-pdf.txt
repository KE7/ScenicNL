A Zoox vehicle in manual mode was proceeding with the right of way through a four-way stop, when a person operating an electric scooter

failed to stop at the stop sign and proceeded into the intersection from the right and made contact with the rear corner of the Zoox vehicle at
low speed. Police were not called.
