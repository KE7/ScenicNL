A Zoox vehicle in manual mode was proceeding straight in its lane on Kearny St. in San Francisco, when an occupant of a parallel parked

car abruptly opened a rear door into the side of the Zoox vehicle, causing minor damage to both vehicles. The Zoox vehicle had disengaged
for unrelated traffic within 30 seconds of the contact. There were no injuries and the police were not called.
