A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a parked vehicle on the
200 block of Parnassus Avenue. While operating in manual mode, the operator of the Waymo vehicle was attempting to enter the adjacent
travel lane from a parallel parked position on the right-hand edge of the street, when they made contact with the rear of a vehicle parked
directly in front of the Waymo vehicle. The Waymo vehicle sustained minor damage to the front bumper and sensor casing. The other
party’s vehicle sustained minor scratches and denting to the rear bumper.
