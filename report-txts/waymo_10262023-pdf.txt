On October 26, 2023 at 7:48 AM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving an SUV on 13th Street near Bernice Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on 13th Street in the rightmost lane. As the SUV in the left adjacent lane traveling alongside the
Waymo AV initiated a right lane change, the front passenger’s side of the SUV made contact with the front driver’s side of the Waymo AV.
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged as the test driver transitioned the Waymo AV to manual mode
just before the contact. Both vehicles sustained damage.
