A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) in autonomous mode was stopped in traffic while in the leftmost lane on southbound San
Antonio Road headed toward Charleston Road in Palo Alto when it was rear-ended by a passenger vehicle maneuvering into the Waymo
AV’s lane at approximately less than 1 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor scratches to its rear sensor, and the passenger vehicle left
the scene. There were no injuries reported at the scene.
