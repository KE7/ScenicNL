On June 5, 2022 at 10:07 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle on Bush Street and Gough Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped in autonomous mode behind stopped traffic facing east on Bush Street. The passenger vehicle ahead of the
Waymo AV transitioned into reverse and began to accelerate, making contact with the front sensor of the Waymo AV. At the time of the

impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position).
Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
