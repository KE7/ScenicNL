A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling westbound in the left lane on
Sacramento Street between Polk Street and Van Ness Avenue. At the same time, a Honda Accord traveling in the right lane behind the
Cruise AV increased speed and maneuvered across the AV's lane into the parking lane to the left of the Cruise AV in an attempt to pass the
Cruise AV. The Honda Accord then began to merge back into the Cruise AV's lane. The Cruise AV braked, but shortly thereafter, contact
was made with the Cruise AV's front left quarter panel and front driver side mirror, damaging the front driver side mirror of the Cruise AV.
The driver of the Honda Accord left the scene without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
