Per the DMV's request of 02/21/2019, Waymo is resubmitting this OL316 so the DMV's digital version is compliant with accessibility
requirements under AB 434. Waymo's original report was submitted on 02/14/2019.

A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (““Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode in the slip-lane from northbound Shoreline Boulevard to
northbound Central Expressway in Mountain View when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV was yielding to approaching traffic from the
left when a passenger vehicle rear-ended the Waymo AV while travelling approximately 4 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage
to the rear bumper, and the passenger vehicle had minor damage to its front bumper. No injuries were reported at the scene but the two

operators in the Waymo AV later reported minor headache and neck soreness. They sought medical attention and both were cleared to
return to work.
