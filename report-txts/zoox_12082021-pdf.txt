A Zoox vehicle was stopped in manual mode while exiting the intersection of Montgomery St. and Pacific St. as a large truck entered the
intersection. While the truck began to make a left turn behind the Zoox vehicle, it made contact with the Zoox rear radar and camera pod on
the driver's side. There were no injuries and the police were not called.
