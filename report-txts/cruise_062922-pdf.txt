A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Clement Street
between 10th Avenue and 9th Avenue. Following the intersection of 10th Avenue mid-block, while engaged in autonomous mode, a
vehicle in an angled parking space on the right backed out into the same lane as the oncoming Cruise AV. The AV operator disengaged
from autonomous into manual mode, and pulled to the left to avoid the vehicle backing up. At this time, contact by a cyclist was made at
the rear driver side bumper of the Cruise AV. There were no reported injuries or damages at the scene by either party and police were
not called. The following day on June 30, 2022, the cyclist claimed damages and injuries related to the event.
