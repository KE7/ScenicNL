A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northwest bound on Columbus Street
approaching the intersection with Jones Street when the Cruise AV slowed down. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from
autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, another vehicle, changing into the Cruise AV’s lane from the left adjacent lane, made contact with
the rear bumper of the Cruise AV. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party and police were not called. Both of the Cruise
AV test operators later mentioned neck and shoulder pain.
