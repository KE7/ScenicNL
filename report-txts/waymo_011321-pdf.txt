A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling northbound on Bartlett Street and turning left onto westbound 26th Street in
San Francisco when it was involved in a collision. The Waymo AV had come to a complete stop at the 4-way stop sign intersection at
Bartlett Street and 26th Street before proceeding to make a left turn in autonomous mode. As the Waymo AV was completing the left turn, a
passenger vehicle traveling eastbound on 26th Street and turning left onto northbound Bartlett Street proceeded into the intersection without
fully stopping at the stop sign. The Waymo AV began to brake for the passenger vehicle and the Waymo AV test driver disengaged
autonomous mode and manually stopped the Waymo AV just prior to the passenger vehicle making contact with the driver’s side of the
Waymo AV. The passenger vehicle was traveling approximately 5 MPH at the time of contact, and the Waymo AV was traveling

approximately 0 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its driver’s side front wheel well and driver door, and the passenger
vehicle sustained minor damage to its front bumper. No injuries were reported.
