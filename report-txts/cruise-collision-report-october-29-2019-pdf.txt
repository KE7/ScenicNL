A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound in a channelized lane on Beach Street
near the intersection with The Embarcadero when it stopped at the traffic light and another vehicle behind the Cruise AV made contact with

its rear bumper. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party and police were not called. The Cruise AV test operators sitting
in the driver’s seat and in the backseat later mentioned back pain.
