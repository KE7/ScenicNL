On January 20, 2022 at 8:36 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on Sunset Boulevard and Judah Street.

While proceeding straight on northbound Sunset Boulevard in manual mode, the operator of the Waymo AV slowed the vehicle while
approaching stopped traffic at the Judah Street intersection. A passenger vehicle approached from behind and made contact with the rear of
the Waymo AV, then immediately left the scene of the collision. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged
and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
