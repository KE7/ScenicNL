The Zoox vehicle, traveling southbound on Hyde St. at the Union St. intersection, was in conventional mode and waiting (stationary) to
make the left turn from Hyde St. onto Union St. The Zoox vehicle had stopped to yield to an oncoming truck. The truck continued
northbound on Hyde Street, and as it passed the Zoox vehicle, its driver-side mirror grazed the driver-side mirror of the Zoox vehicle.
