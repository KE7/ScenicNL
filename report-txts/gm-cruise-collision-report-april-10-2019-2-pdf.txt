A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was approaching the intersection prior to making a left turn
from southbound Lyon Street onto eastbound California Street when the Cruise AV yielded to an overtaking vehicle on its left proceeding
straight on southbound Lyon. Once the overtaking vehicle completed its pass, the Cruise AV attempted to continue its left turn when

another vehicle directly behind the Cruise AV, attempting to turn right on California, made contact with the Cruise AV’s right rear bumper,
damaging the bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called.
