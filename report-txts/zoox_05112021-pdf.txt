A Zoox vehicle in autonomous mode began to slow down during an unprotected left turn to yield for cross traffic entering the lane from the

right. A passenger vehicle from behind did not slow and made contact with the rear sensors of the Zoox vehicle. There were no injuries and
the police were not called.
