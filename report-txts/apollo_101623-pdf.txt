An Apollo autonomous vehicle (“AV”) was traveling westbound on Ortega Street in San Francisco in conventional mode with a safety
operator driving. At the intersection with 46th Ave., the right front of the AV made contact with the curb and the AV traveled onto the
curb. The safety operator was able to drive off the curb and back onto the street. No other vehicles or property were involved. There were
no injuries and the police were not called. The AV sustained minor damage to right wheel fender shield and the right lower bumper.
