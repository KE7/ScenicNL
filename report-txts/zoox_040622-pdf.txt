A Zoox vehicle in autonomous mode was making a right turn from Bryant Street onto 9th Street when a vehicle overtaking from the rear

switched lanes as it drove in front of the Zoox vehicle and made contact with the front Zoox sensors. The other party left the scene. The
police were not called and there were no injuries.
