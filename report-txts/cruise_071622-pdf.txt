A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a stop sign on
westbound Parnassus Avenue at the intersection with 4th Avenue. After the Cruise AV began to proceed straight through the intersection, a
Toyota FJ Cruiser traveling southbound on 4th Avenue approached a stop sign in its direction of travel at the intersection with Parnassus
Avenue. The Toyota FJ Cruiser did not stop for its stop sign and, shortly thereafter, the Toyota FJ Cruiser entered the intersection and made
contact with the Cruise AV as the Cruise AV was passing through the intersection, damaging the rear passenger quarter panel of the Cruise

AV. The driver of the Toyota FJ Cruiser left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries and a police report was later
filed.
