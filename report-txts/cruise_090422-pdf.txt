A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in manual mode, was traveling eastbound on 12th Street between Kissling Street
and Howard Street. Following the intersection of Howard Street, the Cruise AV came to a stop as a Lexus CT200 was stopped in the wrong
direction of traffic on 12th Street. The driver of the Lexus CT200 appeared to be asleep. The Cruise AV operator made attempts to wake up
the driver by flashing the Cruise AV headlights and honking the horn. A nearby cyclist also made attempts to wake up the driver. Shortly
thereafter, the driver of the Lexus CT200 woke up, accelerated forward and made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the front passenger
fender and wheel well of the Cruise AV. There were no reported injuries.
