On June 9, 2023 at 2:47 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger car on Fell Street at Laguna Street.

The Waymo AV was maneuvering out of a parallel parking spot at the right side curb on Fell Street. As it reversed, the rear of the Waymo
AV made contact with the front of the passenger car parked directly behind it. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS

was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both the Waymo AV and the passenger car sustained
damage.
