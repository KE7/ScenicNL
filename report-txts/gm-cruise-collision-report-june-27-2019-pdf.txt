A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was making a right turn from northeast bound Bryant Street

onto southeast bound 10th Street when another vehicle made contact with the Cruise AV’s left rear corner, damaging the upper left tail lamp
assembly. There were no injuries and police were not called.
