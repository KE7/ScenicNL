A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on 24th Street at the intersection with
Mission Street when the Cruise AV yielded to an electric scooterist traveling northbound on Mission Street and violating a red light. The
driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, the electric scooterist made contact with the right rear
corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right rear fascia and brake light. The electric scooterist left the scene without
exchanging information. There were no injuries and police were not called.
