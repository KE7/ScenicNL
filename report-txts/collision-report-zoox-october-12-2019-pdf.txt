The stationary Zoox vehicle was in autonomous mode at the stop sign on Polk St. heading northbound towards Green St. The Zoox vehicle
moved forward slightly, then slowed down in caution to a pedestrian on its left and potential oncoming vehicles when the driver of the
vehicle behind the Zoox vehicle made contact with the rear bumper of the Zoox vehicle. There were no injuries.
