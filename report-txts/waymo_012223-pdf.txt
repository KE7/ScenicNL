On January 22, 2023 at 5:08 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on Bayshore Boulevard at Jerrold Avenue.

The Waymo AV was traveling north on Bayshore Boulevard when, upon entering the intersection at Jerrold Avenue, a passenger vehicle
which had previously been stopped at a red light, proceeded through the red light. The passenger vehicle approached from the left and made
contact with the left rear bumper of the Waymo AV. The other vehicle immediately left the scene of the collision. At the time of the impact,

the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). Both
vehicles sustained damage.
