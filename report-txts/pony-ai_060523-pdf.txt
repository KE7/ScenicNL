On June 5, 2023, while in supervised (““Drivered”) autonomous mode, a Pony.ai AV was rear-ended twice by a passenger vehicle at the
intersection of Warren Ave and Kato Road in Fremont, CA. The Pony.ai AV was stopped at a red stop light when the passenger vehicle
directly behind the Pony.ai AV proceeded to rear-end the Pony.ai AV two times in quick succession. The Pony.ai safety operator
disengaged the Pony.ai AV from autonomous mode, and, concerned for his own safety, immediately drove the vehicle back to the Pony.ai
Fremont office (a distance of approximately | mile). The passenger vehicle which had rear-ended the Pony.ai AV followed the Pony.ai AV
back to Pony.ai’s Fremont office. After a brief interaction during which the driver of the passenger vehicle threatened Pony.ai employees,
the passenger vehicle and driver drove away. The Fremont police took a report about the incident. There were no injuries reported.
