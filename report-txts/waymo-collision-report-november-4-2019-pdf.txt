A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in manual mode on the interchange from eastbound Alma Street about to
merge onto southbound Oregon Expressway in Palo Alto when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV was yielding to cross-traffic when a
passenger vehicle made contact with the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately 1 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to
the rear bumper, and the passenger vehicle sustained no damage. There were no injuries reported at the scene.
