A Pony.AI autonomous vehicle ("Pony AV") in autonomous mode was traveling southbound on Pine Street heading towards Cameron Hills
Drive. A passenger vehicle traveling southbound behind the Pony AV crossed the traffic line and entered the northbound lane of Pine Street
in an attempt to pass the Pony AV. The Pony AV's speed remained consistent. After passing the Pony AV by about a quarter car length,
the passenger vehicle abruptly turned back into the southbound lane of Pine Street such that it was in very close proximity to the front of the
Pony AV. The passenger vehicle then suddenly decelerated. The Pony AV's safety driver disengaged autonomous mode and manually
applied the brake. As a result of the passenger vehicle's sudden deceleration, the Pony AV's front-left bumper made contact with the back-
right bumper of the passenger vehicle causing minor scratches to both vehicles. The safety driver of the Pony AV and the driver of the
