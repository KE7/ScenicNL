A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling southbound on Tennessee Street
between Mariposa Street and 18th Street when it approached a Lexus Sedan that was stopped in the middle of the road between the Cruise
AV’s lane of travel and opposite lane of travel. As the Cruise AV passed the stopped Lexus Sedan on the right, the passenger of the Lexus
Sedan opened their front passenger side door, making contact with the Cruise AV’s lower front driver side bumper fascia. This caused
damage to the Cruise AV’s lower front driver side bumper fascia and front driver side wheel opening molding. The driver of the Lexus
Sedan left the scene without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries.
