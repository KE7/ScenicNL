A Cruise autonomous vehicle (Cruise AV), operating in autonomous mode, was stopped at a stop sign at the four way intersection of Castro
and 22nd Streets. A 2017 Chevy Colorado that was traveling behind the Cruise AV made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV.
This caused damage to the rear bumper of the Cruise AV. There were minor injuries but the police were not called.
