A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) being driven in conventional mode was involved in a collision while traveling in a private
parking lot on the block located between Marina Boulevard and North Point Street on the north and south boundaries and Buchanan and
Laguna Streets on the west and east boundaries, respectively. While the driver of the Cruise AV reversed out of its diagonal parking spot,
another vehicle simultaneously reversing out of its diagonal parking spot on the other side made contact with the right rear corner of the
Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right rear tail lamp assembly. There were no injuries and police were not called.
