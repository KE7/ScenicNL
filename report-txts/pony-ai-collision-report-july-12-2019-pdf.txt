A Pony.ai autonomous vehicle ("Pony AV") in autonomous mode was stopped at a red light at the intersection of Dixon Landing Road and
California Circle. While stopped at the red light, the Pony AV's safety driver noticed that the reverse lights of the vehicle directly in front of
the Pony AV ("Vehicle 2") were on. The Pony AV's safety driver disengaged autonomous mode, observed that there were no vehicles
directly behind it, and reversed 20-30 feet as a precaution. When the traffic light turned green, Vehicle 2 accelerated while still in reverse
toward the Pony AV. Vehicle 2 came to a complete stop about 4 feet from the Pony AV's front bumper. After about 2 seconds, however,
Vehicle 2 continued to reverse in the direction of the Pony AV, resulting in contact between the two vehicles. The contact caused minor
scratches to both vehicles. The Pony AV's safety driver and the driver of Vehicle 2 pulled over at a nearby parking lot and exchanged
information. There were no injuries reported and the police were not called.
