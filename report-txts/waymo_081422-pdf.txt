On August 14th, 2022 at 6:08 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger car on 14th Street at Market Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic in the left-hand lane of 14th Street, facing East. The passenger car that had been stopped behind the
Waymo AV began moving forward. The front of the passenger car made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. When the light turned
green and traffic began moving, the passenger car left the scene. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.

At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s
seating position).
