On April 11, 2022 at 10:36 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a SUV on Townsend Street and Embarcadero.

While traveling southwest on Townsend Street in manual mode, the Waymo AV test driver approached a double-parked vehicle blocking
traffic. The Waymo AV test driver pulled behind the double-parked vehicle. At this time, a SUV following closely behind the Waymo AV
passed the Waymo AV on the left side, making contact with the rear left sensor of the Waymo AV. The SUV left the scene. At the time of

the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo
AV sustained minor damage.
