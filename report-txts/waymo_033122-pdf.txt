On March 31, 2022 at 11:07 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (““Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving an SUV on the 1000 block of Potrero Avenue.

The Waymo AV was stopped at a red traffic light on southbound Potrero Avenue when a pedestrian entered the crosswalk. When the traffic
light turned green, the Waymo AV remained stopped for a crossing pedestrian who had just reached the pedestrian island in the middle of
the crosswalk. After a brief pause, the ADV started to proceed, when the SUV behind the Waymo AV then made contact with the rear of the

Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in
the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
