On April 18, 2022 at 2:31 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA made contact with a
parking lot driveway on the 200 block of Duboce Avenue.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on Duboce Avenue in autonomous mode when it approached a parking lot on the left side of the
street. As the Waymo AV turned left and into the parking lot, the Waymo AV’s undercarriage made contact with the driveway pavement
(the AV did not contact any vehicle or road user). At the time of the contact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous
mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained minor undercarriage damage.
