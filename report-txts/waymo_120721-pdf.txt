On December 7, 2021 at 10:47 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving an SUV at Oak Street at Stanyan Street.

While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV came to a stop at a stop sign on Oak Street. While the ADV was stopped, waiting for a
pedestrian to cross and for traffic on Stanyan Street to clear, an SUV approached the Waymo AV from behind and made contact with the
rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was
present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to the rear bumper.
