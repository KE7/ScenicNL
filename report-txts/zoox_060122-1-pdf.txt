A Zoox vehicle in autonomous mode was proceeding westbound with the right of way on a green traffic light at the six way intersection of
Pacific Ave., Keary St., and Columbus Ave., when a person operating an electric scooter ran a red light and proceeded northbound into the
intersection. The scooter made contact with the left rear quarter panel of the Zoox vehicle, at which time the Zoox vehicle had disengaged
from autonomous mode. The Zoox vehicle pulled over, and police and emergency services arrived at the scene. Zoox is submitting this
