The Waymo AV was traveling east on 25th Street between Sanchez Street and Vicksburg Street when it approached an SUV that was
stopped in the lane in front of the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV began passing the stopped SUV on the left when the SUV began reversing
in the lane. The Waymo AV then stopped behind and to the left of the SUV, and the SUV continued reversing and began a turning
maneuver to enter a parking space. The left side of the SUV made contact with the front right corner of the Waymo AV. At the time of the
impact, the Waymo AV was stopped and the AVâ€™s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage.
