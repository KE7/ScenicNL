On September 26th, a test vehicle operating with the automated driving system engaged was traveling Westbound on Interstate 80 in
Emeryville, CA, when it slowed and came to a complete stop in response to traffic. Approximately three seconds later, and while traffic

remained stopped ahead, a white Chevrolet Silverado made contact from the rear. No injuries were reported and law enforcement was not
called to the scene. Both vehicles sustained damage.
