A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling northbound on Sanchez Street in San Francisco in autonomous mode when it
entered the oncoming lane in order to proceed around a garbage truck and dumpster. As the Waymo AV maneuvered around the garbage
truck and dumpster, the Waymo AV test driver disengaged autonomous mode and took control of the Waymo AV. As the test driver was
attempting to re-enter the northbound lane in manual mode, the Waymo AV’s front driver’s side tire drove over the curb of a traffic island
median and the Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its front bumper. No injuries were reported.
