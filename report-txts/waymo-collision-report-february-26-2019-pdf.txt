A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in autonomous mode at the intersection of Miramonte Avenue and Covington
Road in Los Altos when it was involved in a collision. The Waymo AV was traveling northbound on Miramonte Avenue, when it reached a
four-way stop sign intersection. The Waymo AV stopped to yield to another vehicle at the intersection, at which time a passenger vehicle
rear-ended the Waymo AV at approximately 39 MPH. At the time of the collision the Waymo AV had been stopped for approximately 1.5
seconds. The Waymo AV sustained major damage to its rear bumper, rear hatch, and rear quarter panels, and the passenger vehicle

sustained major damage to its front bumper, hood, and front quarter panels. First responders attended to the scene, but neither party reported
injuries.
