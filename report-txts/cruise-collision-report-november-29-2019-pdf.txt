A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southeast bound on The Embarcadero at the
intersection with Washington Street when the Cruise AV slowed down. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode
and, shortly thereafter, another vehicle made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s rear fascia assembly

and radars. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party and police were not called. Both of the Cruise AV test operators later
mentioned neck and back pain.
