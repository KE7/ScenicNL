A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on McAllister Street
between Van Ness Avenue and Polk Street. As the Cruise AV was slowing for a red light at the intersection with Polk Street, an Infiniti Q60
traveling westbound on McAllister Street failed to stop for the red light, entered the intersection, and made contact with a black sedan
traveling southbound on Polk Street that entered the intersection on a green light. The Infiniti Q60 spun after contact and continued into the
Cruise AV, damaging the front bumper fascia of the Cruise AV. The driver of the Infiniti Q60 was transported by police. There were no
reported injuries and both the Infiniti Q60 and the black sedan were towed from the scene.
