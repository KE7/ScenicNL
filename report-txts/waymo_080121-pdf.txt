On August 1, 2021 at 4:48 PM PDT, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was struck by a
bicycle at Cabrillo Street and 23rd Avenue. The Waymo AV had stopped at a stop sign on Cabrillo Street and, when the intersection was
clear, began to proceed westbound through the intersection with 23rd Avenue. At approximately the same time, a cyclist traveling
northbound ran the stop sign on 23rd Avenue, began to turn right onto Cabrillo Street but immediately veered left to continue northbound
across the crosswalk on Cabrillo Street, where it struck the rear driver’s side of the Waymo AV. The cyclist stayed upright and immediately
rode away, continuing northbound on 23rd Avenue. The bicycle caused minor scratches and marks on the rear driver’s side bumper of the
Waymo AV. The Waymo AV was operating with a driver (in the driver’s seating position), who transitioned the vehicle from autonomous
to manual mode approximately | second before the impact occurred. At the time of impact, the Waymo AV was in manual mode.
