A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was waiting for oncoming traffic to clear the intersection
before making a left turn onto Bush Street from southbound Steiner Street when another vehicle made contact with the right rear corner of
the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right rear fascia, bumper, and wheel well. There were no injuries and police were not called.
