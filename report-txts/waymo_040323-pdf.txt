On April 3, 2023 at 10:56 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving an SUV on Jack London Alley at Varney Place.

While traveling northwest on Jack London Alley, the Waymo AV came to a stop to yield to an oncoming SUV in a narrow passageway. The
SUV proceeded around the Waymo AV and made contact with the left rear sensor housing of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the

Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The driver of
the SUV stopped briefly but left before sharing their information. The Waymo sustained damage.
