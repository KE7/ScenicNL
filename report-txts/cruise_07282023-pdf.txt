A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Van Ness Avenue
between California Street and Sacramento Street. As the Cruise AV was passing through the intersection with Sacramento Street on a green
light, a bag lying on the roadway blew in front of the Cruise AV. The Cruise AV braked for the object, and a white pickup truck traveling
behind the Cruise AV rear-ended the Cruise AV, damaging the rear right bumper, rear right quarter panel, and rear windshield. The driver
of the white pickup truck left the scene without exchanging information. There were no reported injuries and the Cruise AV was towed.
