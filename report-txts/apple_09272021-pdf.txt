A test vehicle, operating in autonomous mode in Sunnyvale and turning right from Mathilda Avenue onto Del Ray Avenue, made contact
with a curb at approximately 13 miles per hour. While there was no tire or wheel damage, the contact resulted in misalignment. No other
agents were involved, no injuries were reported, and law enforcement was not called to the scene.
