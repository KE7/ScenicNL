A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was proceeding westbound on Eddy Street at the intersection
with Leavenworth Street when another vehicle made contact with the center rear bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s left
center rear bumper and radar connector. Police were not called and no injuries were reported at the scene by either party. Both of the
Cruise AV testers sitting in passenger seats later sought medical attention for neck stiffness.
