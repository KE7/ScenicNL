A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Turk Street through the
intersection with Steiner Street when another vehicle encroached into the Cruise AV's lane from the right adjacent lane and made contact
with the right side of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV's right front fender, right front door, and right rear door and the other
vehicle's front left bumper and fender. There were no injuries and police were not called.
