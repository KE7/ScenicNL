A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”) being driven in conventional mode was involved in a collision on Delancey Street south of the
intersection with Brannan Street. While the driver of the Cruise AV was reversing out of its perpendicular parking spot on Delancey,
another vehicle simultaneously reversing out of its perpendicular parking spot on the opposite side of the street made contact with the rear
bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s left tail lamp assembly and rear fascia. There were no injuries reported at the scene by
either party and police were not called. Days after the collision, both of the Cruise AV test operators reported injuries.
