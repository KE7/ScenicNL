A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was traveling eastbound on Fulton Street in the
leftmost lane between 14th Avenue and Park Presidio Boulevard. A Toyota Sienna traveling southbound on 14th Avenue made an
unprotected left turn to merge onto eastbound Fulton Street. The Cruise AV braked prior to the Cruise AV operator disengaging the Cruise
AV from autonomous mode. The Cruise AV operator continued to brake but, shortly thereafter, the Toyota Sienna made contact with the
Cruise AV, damaging the front left fender of the Cruise AV. Police were not called to the scene and no injuries were reported.
