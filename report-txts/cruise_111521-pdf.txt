A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in supervised autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a stop sign
on westbound 17th Street at the intersection with Roosevelt Way. Another vehicle approaching from the rear made contact with the Cruise
AV's rear bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called. The Cruise AV test operator later mentioned neck pain.
