A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was stopped at a red light on northbound 6th Street at the

intersection with Harrison Street when a lane-splitting cyclist made contact with the Cruise AV’s right side mirror, damaging the mirror.
The cyclist did not stop. There were no injuries and police were not called.
