A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was facing west and stopped for a red light at the intersection
of Duboce and Guerrero Streets. Before the Cruise AV started to proceed for the green light, contact was made to the rear bumper of the

Cruise AV by a BMW traveling behind the AV. The contact caused minimal damage to the rear bumper of the Cruise AV. There were no
injuries and the police were not called.
