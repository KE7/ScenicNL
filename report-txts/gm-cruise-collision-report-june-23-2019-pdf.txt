A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Divisadero Street through the
intersection with Fell Street when the Cruise AV slowed down. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and,

shortly thereafter, another vehicle made contact with the Cruise AV’s rear bumper, damaging the rear bumper and fascia assembly. There
were no injuries and police were not called.
