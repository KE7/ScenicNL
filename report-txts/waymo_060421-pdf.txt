A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in manual mode southbound on Jones Street at Ellis Street in San Francisco
when a cyclist fell while passing between the Waymo AV and another vehicle. The Waymo AV test driver was traveling approximately 15
MPH and then gradually slowed and came to a stop for a passenger vehicle in its lane making a right turn onto Ellis Street. A cyclist
following the Waymo AV at approximately 19 MPH then attempted to pass the Waymo AV on the left side and travel between the Waymo
AV’s driver’s side and a faster-moving passenger vehicle in the left adjacent lane. As the cyclist attempted to overtake the Waymo AV and
was in turn being overtaken by the adjacent passenger vehicle, the cyclist fell between the two vehicles. As the bicycle was falling, the
bicycle’s front tire appears to have made contact with the rear driver’s side wheel of the Waymo AV, and the cyclist appears to have made
contact with the side of the other passenger vehicle in the left adjacent lane. The Waymo AV sustained no damage. The passenger vehicle
did not stop and left the scene. The cyclist was transported from the scene and reportedly treated for potential head injuries.
