On August 20, 2023 at 5:49 PM PT the mirror of a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was
struck by a cyclist on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive at Crossover Drive.

The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic on eastbound Martin Luther King Jr. Drive at the intersection with Crossover Drive, when a cyclist
that had been traveling behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left. As the cyclist passed the Waymo AV, the cyclist made
contact with the driver side mirror of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in

autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained damage and the cyclist did not
stop, leaving the scene without exchanging information.
