An Apollo autonomous vehicle (“AV”) was traveling westbound on Rivera Street in San Francisco in autonomous mode and stopped for a
double-parked vehicle near 31st Avenue. An Apollo safety operator disengaged the AV from autonomous mode into conventional mode
with use of the steering wheel. Then the AV side-swiped the double-parked vehicle while in conventional mode. There were no injuries and
emergency services were not needed. Both the AV and the second vehicle sustained minor damage.
