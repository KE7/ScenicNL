A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling westbound on 16th Street at Market Street in San Francisco when it was
involved in a collision. While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV was stopped at a red traffic light at the unprotected intersection of 16th
Street and Market Street. After the traffic light turned green, the Waymo AV began to proceed and then came to a stop as it yielded to
oncoming traffic also entering the intersection. A passenger vehicle behind the Waymo AV then made contact with the stationary Waymo
AV’s rear bumper at approximately 5 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to its rear bumper, and the passenger vehicle
sustained minor damage to its front bumper. No injuries were reported.
