The Pony.ai autonomous vehicle ("Pony.ai AV") stopped at a red light on the corner of Jamboree Rd and MacArthur Blvd, preparing to
make a right tum on red. The Pony.ai AV crept into the intersection before stopping to yield to oncoming traffic. While stopped, the Pony.ai
AV was rear-ended by the vehicle behind it ("Vehicle 2"). The contact between the vehicles caused a moderate dent to the back of the

Pony.ai AV and minor damage to Vehicle 2. Both drivers pulled over to the side of the roadway and exchanged information. There were no
injuries reported and the police were not called.

The driver of Vehicle 2 admitted complete fault and responsibility.
