A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northwest bound on 9th Street near the
intersection with Folsom Street in the right lane when it stopped due to traffic ahead in the intersection. Shortly thereafter, another vehicle
made contact with the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV's left rear bumper, wheel well, and tail lamp and the other vehicle's front right
bumper, headlight, and fender. The Cruise AV test operator sitting in the front passenger seat reported back pain at the scene, but did not
request emergency assistance. Police were not called.
