On October 28, 2021 at 9:35 PM PDT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a van at Silver Avenue at Bayshore Boulevard.

The Waymo AV, while in autonomous mode, was waiting to make a left turn from Silver Avenue onto Bayshore Boulevard and yielding to
oncoming traffic, when the test driver (in the driver’s seating position) transitioned to manual mode and proceeded with a left turn manually.
During the left turn, an approaching van made contact with the front bumper of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo
AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor
damage to its front bumper, and the van sustained minor damage to its front bumper.
