A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on 17th Street at the intersection
with Potrero St., when the Cruise AV was struck by a 2007 Subaru Outback that crossed the centerline while driving eastbound on 17th
Street. Immediately before the incident, the driver of the Cruise AV, seeing the oncoming vehicle crossing the centerline, disengaged from
autonomous mode and brought the Cruise AV to a stop. The oncoming car made contact with the front driver side quarter panel of the

Cruise AV, causing damage. There were no injuries, but the police were called. The driver of the 2007 Subaru Outback left the scene before
the police arrived.
