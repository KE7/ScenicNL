A Zoox vehicle in autonomous mode was proceeding straight through the intersection of Mason St. and Ellis St. when it was rear-ended by

a passenger vehicle that was switching lanes and made contact with the Zoox vehicle's sensors. The other party left the scene. The police
were not called, and there were no injuries.
