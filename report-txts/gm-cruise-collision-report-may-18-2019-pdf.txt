A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was about to make a left turn after stopping at the four-way
stop sign on westbound Euclid Avenue at the intersection with Palm Avenue when another vehicle made contact with the rear bumper of the

Cruise AV. Police were not called and no injuries were reported at the scene by either party. Two of the Cruise AV testers sitting in the
driver and front passenger seats later mentioned injuries.
