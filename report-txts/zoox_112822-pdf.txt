A Zoox vehicle in autonomy was fully stopped with brake lights illuminated in the left turn lane at a red traffic light waiting to complete a
left hand turn from Harrison St. onto 11th St in San Francisco, Ca. As the light turned green, the Zoox vehicle appropriately yielded to
oncoming traffic when Vehicle 2 attempted to make a lane change to the right and struck the rear of the Zoox vehicle. The Zoox vehicle
incurred minor damage to the rear sensors and bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called.
