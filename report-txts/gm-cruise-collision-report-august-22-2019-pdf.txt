A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on Geary Boulevard between 32nd
and 33rd Avenues when another vehicle, traveling in the right adjacent lane, changed into the same lane as the Cruise AV and made contact

with the right rear corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right rear fascia and bumper. There were no injuries and police were
not called.
