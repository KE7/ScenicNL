Human:
Scenic is a probabilistic programming language for modeling the environments of autonomous cars. A Scenic program defines a distribution over scenes, configurations of physical objects and agents. Scenic can also define (probabilistic) policies for dynamic agents, allowing modeling scenarios where agents take actions over time in response to the state of the world. We use CARLA to render the scenes and simulate the agents.

Here is one example of a fully compiling Scenic program:
{example_1}

Create a fully compiling Scenic program that models the description based on:

1. The following natural language description:
{natural_language_description}

2. The following scenic program with compiler errors that models the description:
{first_attempt_scenic_program}

3. The first compiler error raised with the scenic program:
{compiler_error}

Please output a modified version of scenic_program modified so the compiler error does not appear.

OUTPUT NO OTHER LEADING OR TRAILING TEXT OR WHITESPACE BESIDES THE CORRECTED SCENIC PROGRAM. NO ONE CARES.
Output only the natural language description of the scenario as a comment at the top of the file and your proposed Scenic program. DO NOT output any other text or whitespace so I can run your program and see the results.
