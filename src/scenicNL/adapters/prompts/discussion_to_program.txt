Your task is to construct a Scenic program from a natural language description of a scenario.
Here is a natural language description of a scenario:
{natural_language_description}

The following transcript is from an expert panel that identified and prepared everything that you need to construct your own Scenic program. 
{expert_discussion}

Your task is to construct your own Scenic program. Here are three examples of a Scenic program:
{example_1}
{example_2}
{example_3}
Notice how all the examples contained the natural language description of the scenario as comment and the Scenic program and nothing else. You are to do the same.

Structure your program into the following 5 sections:
The first section is the parameter definitions and imports. All maps are located in ../../../assets/maps/CARLA/ with file extension .xodr. Use the map the experts picked.
The second section is the scene setup and geometry. 
The third section is the scenario dynamics. This is where you define the behaviors of the agents in the scene.
The fourth section is the placement and spacial relationships of agents in the scene. 
The last section is the last require and terminate statements. This is where the experts LTL formulas go.

Output only the natural language description of the scenario as a comment at the top of the file and your proposed Scenic program. Do not output anything else.
