    Scenic is a probabilistic programming language for modeling the environments of autonomous cars. A Scenic program defines a distribution over scenes, configurations of physical objects and agents. Scenic can also define (probabilistic) policies for dynamic agents, allowing modeling scenarios where agents take actions over time in response to the state of the world. We use CARLA to render the scenes and simulate the agents.

    We are going to play a game. For the following question, imagine that you are 3 different autonomous driving experts. For every question, each expert must briefly provide a step-by-step explanation for how they came up with their answer.

      one: |-
        An autonomous Ford Explorer SUV, operating in full autonomous mode, was navigating the ramp to merge onto Sand Hill Road amidst a heavy rainstorm. The vehicle's sensors detected the wet road conditions and adjusted speed accordingly. However, the driver claims' there was debris on the road and they adjusted accordingly. They encountered an unexpected large puddle which caused the vehicle to hydroplane, leading to a temporary loss of traction. The autonomous system attempted corrective steering maneuvers, but the vehicle ultimately made contact with the guardrail on the right side of the ramp. The collision resulted in moderate damage to the vehicle's right rear quarter panel and bumper. No injuries were reported, as the vehicle was unoccupied except for the presence of a safety operator, who did not sustain any injuries. The California Highway Patrol was notified and arrived on the scene to document the incident and assist in the vehicle's recovery. The incident highlighted the challenges faced by autonomous vehicles in severe weather conditions and the need for ongoing improvements in sensor and navigation technologies to handle such situations.

      two: |-
        At approximately 12:05 PM, an autonomous BMW i8 convertible was eastbound on University Avenue when it collided with a city bus running a red light at Hamilton Avenue. At the same time, a scooter rider and a bicyclist, legally crossing Hamilton, narrowly avoided the incident, while two pedestrians were nearby on the sidewalk. Despite the BMW’s attempt to avoid the collision through emergency braking and evasive maneuvers, it sustained significant front-end damage, and the bus minor damage on its right side. Three bus passengers reported minor injuries. The complex scenario, involving multiple road users, highlighted the challenges autonomous vehicles face in dynamic urban environments. The primary cause was identified as the bus driver's failure to obey the traffic signal.

      three: |-
        A Chevy Cruise autonomous vehicle, while in autonomous mode, was attempting to merge onto northbound Maple Ave from 5th Street when a bicyclist unexpectedly entered the vehicle's path, causing the vehicle to apply emergency braking. The bicyclist made minor contact with the front sensor array of the vehicle but managed to remain upright and uninjured. The vehicle sustained minimal damage to its front sensor array. No law enforcement was called to the scene, and the incident was recorded by the vehicle's onboard cameras for further analysis.

      four: |-
        An autonomous Audi A4 convertible, operating in full autonomous mode, was traveling north on 4th Street approaching Grand Avenue under sunny conditions. As the vehicle entered the intersection on a green light, a delivery truck running a red light from Grand Avenue intersected its path. Simultaneously, a skateboarder was crossing 4th Street within the crosswalk, and a dog, leashed to a nearby lamppost, became startled and attempted to run across the intersection. The Audi's advanced detection systems initiated an emergency stop, avoiding a collision with the truck and ensuring the skateboarder and dog remained unharmed. The incident caused minor traffic disruption but highlighted the vehicle's ability to respond to multiple hazards effectively. No damage or injuries were reported, and the truck driver was cited for running the red light.

      five: |-
        During a light rain, a Tesla Model S in autonomous mode was driving west on Elm Street. As it approached the junction with 5th Avenue, a cyclist unexpectedly swerved into the lane from the sidewalk to avoid a puddle. At the same time, a pedestrian, distracted by their phone, stepped off the curb against the "Don't Walk" signal. The Tesla, utilizing its automatic emergency braking and evasive maneuver capabilities, managed to avoid contact with both the cyclist and pedestrian, coming to a stop in the intersection. The rapid response of the vehicle's systems prevented potential injuries. No damages were reported, and after a brief pause to ensure the safety of all parties, the vehicle continued on its route.

        The description involves an autonomous vehicle, specifically a Ford Explorer SUV. In the provided lists of vehicle models, there is no direct match for a "Ford Explorer SUV." However, we can select the closest match based on the brand and the type of vehicle, which in this case would be a car (SUV). The closest matches from the car models list under the Ford brand are "Ford - Crown (taxi)" and "Ford - Mustang." Since neither of these is an SUV, but are the only Ford options provided, we'll include them as the closest available matches.

        My answer is:
        SUV = ["vehicle.ford.crown", "vehicle.ford.mustang"]

        Identifying static objects and conditions from the description:

        1. **Weather Condition**: Heavy rainstorm implies a weather condition that could be classified as "HardRainNoon" or "HardRainSunset" or "HardRainNight" depending on the time of day the incident occurred. Since the time of day is not specified, all three possibilities are considered.
        2. **Road Debris**: The driver claimed there was debris on the road, which the autonomous vehicle had to adjust for. The closest matches from the provided models would be items from the `roadDebrisModels` list.
        3. **Large Puddle**: There's no direct match for a puddle, but it contributes to the wet road conditions already accounted for in the weather condition.
        4. **Guardrail**: While a guardrail is mentioned, there's no direct model match in the provided lists. The closest related object might be something that serves as a barrier, so "trafficBarrierModels" could be considered the closest match.

        My answer is:
        WEATHER_CONDITIONS = ["HardRainNoon", "HardRainSunset", "HardRainNight"]
        ROAD_DEBRIS = ["static.prop.dirtdebris01", "static.prop.dirtdebris02", "static.prop.dirtdebris03"]
        TRAFFIC_BARRIER = ["static.prop.streetbarrier", "static.prop.chainbarrier", "static.prop.chainbarrierend"]

        Identifying static objects and conditions from the description:

        1. **Weather Condition**: The incident occurred at approximately 12:05 PM, which suggests a daytime scenario. However, there's no specific mention of weather conditions, so the closest match considering the time would be "ClearNoon" as the default assumption in the absence of any mention of adverse weather.
        2. **City Bus**: There's no direct match for a city bus in the provided lists, so no static object model can be directly assigned for the bus.
        3. **Scooter Rider and Bicyclist**: These are dynamic objects (users of the road) rather than static objects, so they don't match any of the provided models.
        4. **Pedestrians**: Similarly, pedestrians are dynamic objects and do not match any static object models provided.
        5. **Traffic Signal**: While a traffic signal is crucial to the incident, there's no direct match in the provided lists. The closest related objects might be something that serves as a road sign or indicator, so "roadsideAdvertisementBillboardModels" could be considered for its role in road signaling, albeit not a perfect match.

        My answer is:
        WEATHER_CONDITION = "ClearNoon"
        ROAD_SIGN = ["static.prop.advertisement", "static.prop.streetsign", "static.prop.streetsign01", "static.prop.streetsign04"]

        Identifying static objects and conditions from the description:

        1. **Weather Condition**: There's no mention of weather conditions in the incident description. Without any indication of adverse weather, the default assumption could be clear weather. However, without a specific time of day mentioned, it's challenging to choose between "ClearNoon", "ClearSunset", or "ClearNight". In the absence of further details, all three are considered possibilities.
        2. **Bicyclist**: The bicyclist is a dynamic object rather than a static one, so it doesn't match any of the provided static object models.
        3. **Front Sensor Array Damage**: The damage to the vehicle's front sensor array is specific to the vehicle and does not match any of the provided static object models.

        Given the information, the only variable that can be somewhat determined is the weather condition, with a broad assumption due to the lack of specific details about the time of day or weather.

        My answer is:
        WEATHER_CONDITIONS = ["ClearNoon", "ClearSunset", "ClearNight"]
        
      assistant_answer_4: |
        Identifying static objects and conditions from the description:

        1. **Weather Condition**: The incident occurred under sunny conditions, which directly matches "ClearNoon" if we assume the incident happened around noon given the typical association of sunny conditions with midday.
        2. **Delivery Truck**: The delivery truck is a dynamic object and does not match any of the provided static object models.
        3. **Skateboarder**: The skateboarder is a dynamic object, not a static one, so it doesn't match any of the provided static object models.
        4. **Dog Leashed to a Lamppost**: The dog is a dynamic object, but the lamppost to which it was leashed can be considered a static object. However, there's no direct match for a lamppost in the provided lists. The closest related objects might be something that serves as a street fixture, but without a direct match, this detail cannot be accurately represented with the provided models.
        5. **Advanced Detection Systems**: This refers to the vehicle's technology and does not match any of the provided static object models.

        Given the information, the only variable that can be directly determined is the weather condition.

        My answer is:
        WEATHER_CONDITION = "ClearNoon"

      assistant_answer_5: |
        Identifying static objects and conditions from the description:

        1. **Weather Condition**: The incident occurred during a light rain, which directly matches "SoftRainNoon" if we assume the incident happened around noon, or "SoftRainSunset" if in the evening, or "SoftRainNight" for nighttime, as the specific time of day is not mentioned.
        2. **Cyclist**: The cyclist is a dynamic object and does not match any of the provided static object models.
        3. **Pedestrian**: Similarly, the pedestrian is a dynamic object and does not match any of the provided static object models.
        4. **Puddle**: While the puddle is mentioned as part of the scenario, it is not a static object in the context of the provided models and is more a condition of the wet road, which is already accounted for in the weather condition.
        5. **Automatic Emergency Braking and Evasive Maneuver Capabilities**: These refer to the vehicle's technology and do not match any of the provided static object models.

        Given the information, the only variable that can be directly determined is the weather condition.

        My answer is:
        WEATHER_CONDITIONS = ["SoftRainNoon", "SoftRainSunset", "SoftRainNight"]

      Original description:
      At approximately 12:05 PM, an autonomous BMW i8 convertible was eastbound on University Avenue when it collided with a city bus running a red light at Hamilton Avenue. At the same time, a scooter rider and a bicyclist, legally crossing Hamilton, narrowly avoided the incident, while two pedestrians were nearby on the sidewalk. Despite the BMW’s attempt to avoid the collision through emergency braking and evasive maneuvers, it sustained significant front-end damage, and the bus minor damage on its right side. Three bus passengers reported minor injuries. The complex scenario, involving multiple road users, highlighted the challenges autonomous vehicles face in dynamic urban environments. The primary cause was identified as the bus driver's failure to obey the traffic signal.

      Original description:
      An autonomous Ford Explorer SUV, operating in full autonomous mode, was navigating the ramp to merge onto Sand Hill Road amidst a heavy rainstorm. The vehicle's sensors detected the wet road conditions and adjusted speed accordingly. However, the driver claims' there was debris on the road and they adjusted accordingly. They encountered an unexpected large puddle which caused the vehicle to hydroplane, leading to a temporary loss of traction. The autonomous system attempted corrective steering maneuvers, but the vehicle ultimately made contact with the guardrail on the right side of the ramp. The collision resulted in moderate damage to the vehicle's right rear quarter panel and bumper. No injuries were reported, as the vehicle was unoccupied except for the presence of a safety operator, who did not sustain any injuries. The California Highway Patrol was notified and arrived on the scene to document the incident and assist in the vehicle's recovery. The incident highlighted the challenges faced by autonomous vehicles in severe weather conditions and the need for ongoing improvements in sensor and navigation technologies to handle such situations.

      A user will provide you with a list of main objects from a description. For each of the main objects, find the closest matching models from the list below. If there are any objects in the original description that you see a match for (e.g. a traffic cone), include them in your answer even if they are not listed as a main object. Specify your answer as the string value of that model. You CANNOT under any circumstance pick models that are not listed here. You must select only from the list provided. If there is no direct match or you are unsure, pick ALL eligible similar models as a python list. Never leave empty choices. You should prefer lists over single choices. Provide step-by-step reasoning for any decision you make. Specify your final answer as python code with variables in all caps. In your final answer, only respond with python code as plain text without code block syntax around it.

      An autonomous Ford Explorer SUV, operating in full autonomous mode, was navigating the ramp to merge onto Sand Hill Road amidst a heavy rainstorm. The vehicle's sensors detected the wet road conditions and adjusted speed accordingly. However, the driver claims' there was debris on the road and they adjusted accordingly. They encountered an unexpected large puddle which caused the vehicle to hydroplane, leading to a temporary loss of traction. The autonomous system attempted corrective steering maneuvers, but the vehicle ultimately made contact with the guardrail on the right side of the ramp. The collision resulted in moderate damage to the vehicle's right rear quarter panel and bumper. No injuries were reported, as the vehicle was unoccupied except for the presence of a safety operator, who did not sustain any injuries. The California Highway Patrol was notified and arrived on the scene to document the incident and assist in the vehicle's recovery.

      Based on the missing object information from the user, provide a reasonable probability distribution over the missing values. Answer only the questions that are about distance between objects, speed, weather, or time. For example, if the time of day is missing but you know that the scene is in the morning, you could use a normal distribution with mean 8am and standard deviation 1 hour (Normal(8, 1)). If the color of the car is missing, you could use a uniform distribution over common car color string names. If the car speed is missing, you could use a normal distribution with mean around a reasonable speed limit for area of the scene and reasonable standard deviation, etc.

      First provide step-by-step reasoning as to why you choose such a distribution then provide your final answer as a numbered list. Be concise in your reasoning (no more than 1-2 sentences per object) and specify your answer in the following format:

      REASONING:
      1. The speed at which the autonomous Ford Explorer SUV was traveling on the ramp during the heavy rainstorm can be modeled using a normal distribution with a mean around the speed limit for ramps (e.g., 35-45 mph) and a reasonable standard deviation to account for variations in driving behavior and road conditions.

      2. The size of the unexpected puddle that caused the vehicle to hydroplane can be modeled using a normal distribution with a mean based the fact that the puddle must have been at least as wide as the vehicle and on common puddle sizes on roads (e.g., 6-8 feet in diameter) and a standard deviation to capture variations in puddle sizes.

      3. The type of debris present on the road that the driver had to avoid can be modeled using a uniform distribution over the provided ROAD_DEBRIS_MODEL options ["static.prop.dirtdebris01", "static.prop.dirtdebris02"].

      4. The presence of other vehicles in the vicinity on the ramp at the time of the incident can be modeled using a Bernoulli distribution with a parameter reflecting the likelihood of other vehicles being present (e.g., low probability due to heavy rainstorm and specific location).

      5. The specific weather conditions present during the heavy rainstorm (e.g., visibility, wind speed) can be modeled using a combination of distributions such as normal distribution for visibility range and wind speed based on historical weather data for the area.

      6. The response of the autonomous system to the hydroplaning situation before the collision occurred can be modeled as a categorical distribution with options such as "applied corrective steering maneuvers," "adjusted speed," "issued warnings to safety operator," etc.

      FINAL_ANSWER:
      1. Speed at which the autonomous Ford Explorer SUV was traveling: Normal distribution with mean around 40 mph and standard deviation 5 mph.
      2. Size of the unexpected puddle: Normal distribution with mean around 7 feet in diameter and standard deviation 0.5 feet.

      A user will provide you with probability distributions for missing information. You must interpret the distributions, replace them with the closest matching Scenic distributions.

      Scenic only supports the following distributions so you must only use these in your final answer:
      Range(low, high) - Uniform distribution over the range [low, high]
      DiscreteRange(low, high) - Uniform distribution over the discreet integer range [low, high]
      Normal(mean, std) - Normal distribution with mean and standard deviation
      TruncatedNormal(mean, stdDev, low, high) - Normal distribution with mean and standard deviation truncated to the range [low, high]
      Uniform(value, …) - Uniform distribution over the values provided
      Discrete([value: weight, … ]) - Discrete distribution over the values provided with the given weights (e.g., [value: 0.5, value: 0.2, value: 0.3])

      Any other distribution (Categorical, Bernoulli, Poison, etc.) IS NOT SUPPORTED. They CANNOT be in your FINAL_ANSWER. Replace them with  the closest matching supported distribution (Range, DiscreteRange, Normal, TruncatedNormal, Uniform, or Discrete)

      Note that for weather, you can only provide a Uniform or Discrete distribution over the following values:
      ['ClearNoon', 'CloudyNoon', 'WetNoon', 'WetCloudyNoon', 'SoftRainNoon', 'MidRainyNoon', 'HardRainNoon', 'ClearSunset', 'CloudySunset', 'WetSunset', 'WetCloudySunset', 'SoftRainSunset', 'MidRainSunset', 'HardRainSunset',
      'ClearNight', 'CloudyNight', 'WetNight', 'WetCloudyNight', 'SoftRainNight', 'MidRainyNight', 'HardRainNight' ,'DustStorm']
      So for example, if the description says that the road was wet around the evening, then the weather was most likely rainy, you could use a Discrete distribution as:
      WEATHER = Discrete(['WetSunset': 0.7, 'WetCloudySunset': 0.2, 'WetNight': 0.1])

      Based on the distributions and original description, define Scenic distributions over the uncertain values. Provide values for the parameters to your distributions. DO NOT use any of the other distributions. If you cannot find a distribution that matches the missing information, you must choose the closest matching distribution. If you are unsure of the parameter values, pick the best numerical values as appropriate for the scene.

      Answer by providing step-by-step reasoning as to why you choose such a distribution. Remember to replace unsupported distributions. Then provide your final answer as code.

      Original description:
      An autonomous Ford Explorer SUV, operating in full autonomous mode, was navigating the ramp to merge onto Sand Hill Road amidst a heavy rainstorm. The vehicle's sensors detected the wet road conditions and adjusted speed accordingly. However, the driver claims' there was debris on the road and they adjusted accordingly. They encountered an unexpected large puddle which caused the vehicle to hydroplane, leading to a temporary loss of traction. The autonomous system attempted corrective steering maneuvers, but the vehicle ultimately made contact with the guardrail on the right side of the ramp. The collision resulted in moderate damage to the vehicle's right rear quarter panel and bumper. No injuries were reported, as the vehicle was unoccupied except for the presence of a safety operator, who did not sustain any injuries. The California Highway Patrol was notified and arrived on the scene to document the incident and assist in the vehicle's recovery. The incident highlighted the challenges faced by autonomous vehicles in severe weather conditions and the need for ongoing improvements in sensor and navigation technologies to handle such situations.

      Relevant objects:
      AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLE_MODEL = "vehicle.ford.crown"
      ROAD_DEBRIS_MODEL = ["static.prop.dirtdebris01", "static.prop.dirtdebris02"]

      Missing information:
      1. Can you provide more details about the speed at which the autonomous Ford Explorer SUV was traveling on the ramp during the heavy rainstorm?
      2. How large was the unexpected puddle that caused the vehicle to hydroplane?
      3. What type of debris was present on the road that the driver had to avoid?
      4. Were there any other vehicles in the vicinity on the ramp at the time of the incident?
      5. What specific weather conditions were present during the heavy rainstorm (e.g., visibility, wind speed)?
      6. How did the autonomous system respond to the hydroplaning situation before the collision occurred?

    assistant_answer_1: |
      REASONING:
      1. For the speed of the autonomous Ford Explorer SUV during the heavy rainstorm, we can use a TruncatedNormal distribution with a mean around a reasonable speed for a ramp area and a standard deviation to capture variability while ensuring the speed is within possible values.
      2. To estimate the size of the unexpected puddle that caused the vehicle to hydroplane, we can use a Normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation based on common sizes of puddles that can lead to hydroplaning.
      3. The type of debris present on the road that the driver had to avoid can be modeled using a Uniform distribution over the provided ROAD_DEBRIS_MODEL options.
      4. Since there is no explicit mention of other vehicles in the vicinity, we can use a Uniform distribution to represent uncertainty about the presence of other vehicles on the ramp at the time of the incident.
      5. The specific weather conditions during the heavy rainstorm can be represented using a Discrete distribution over the possible weather conditions listed in Scenic for heavy rain events.

      FINAL_ANSWER:
      AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLE_SPEED = TruncatedNormal(mean=45, stdDev=7.5, low=30, high=60)
      PUDDLE_SIZE = Normal(mean=2, std=0.5)

      Original description:
      At approximately 12:05 PM, an autonomous BMW i8 convertible was eastbound on University Avenue when it collided with a city bus running a red light at Hamilton Avenue. At the same time, a scooter rider and a bicyclist, legally crossing Hamilton, narrowly avoided the incident, while two pedestrians were nearby on the sidewalk. Despite the BMW’s attempt to avoid the collision through emergency braking and evasive maneuvers, it sustained significant front-end damage, and the bus minor damage on its right side. Three bus passengers reported minor injuries. The complex scenario, involving multiple road users, highlighted the challenges autonomous vehicles face in dynamic urban environments. The primary cause was identified as the bus driver's failure to obey the traffic signal.

      Relevant objects:
      AUTONOMOUS_VEHICLE_MODEL = "vehicle.bmw.grandtourer"

      Missing information:
      1. What was the approximate speed of the autonomous BMW i8 convertible when it was traveling eastbound on University Avenue?
      2. Can you provide more details about the evasive maneuvers that the BMW attempted to avoid the collision?
      3. How close were the scooter rider and bicyclist to the point of impact between the BMW and the city bus?
      4. Were there any specific actions taken by the scooter rider and bicyclist to avoid the collision?
      5. How far away were the two pedestrians on the sidewalk from the intersection where the collision occurred?
      6. What were the weather conditions like at the time of the incident?
      7. Were there any specific road markings or signs at the intersection of University Avenue and Hamilton Avenue that may have influenced the events leading up to the collision?
      7. How did the autonomous system of the BMW respond to the situation when it detected the city bus running a red light?
      9. Were there any traffic congestion or other vehicles around the intersection that could have affected the incident?

    assistant_answer_2: |
      REASONING:
      1. The speed of the autonomous BMW i8 convertible traveling eastbound on University Avenue is likely within the typical speed range for urban roads. A normal distribution with a mean of 30 mph and a standard deviation of 5 mph captures this variability in driving conditions.

      2. The evasive maneuvers attempted by the BMW to avoid the collision can be categorized into options such as emergency braking, swerving left, swerving right, etc., which fits a categorical distribution. However, Scenic does not support categorical so we can replace it with Uniform.

      3. The proximity of the scooter rider and bicyclist to the point of impact between the BMW and the city bus is unknown except that they narrowly avoided the incident. We can model this distance between them as a Range between really close (1 foot) and close (6ft standard car with).

      4. The actions taken by the scooter rider and bicyclist to avoid the collision can be categorized into options like braking, changing direction, accelerating, etc., fitting a categorical distribution. However, Scenic does not support categorical so we can replace it with Uniform. 

      5. The distance of the two pedestrians on the sidewalk from the intersection where the collision occurred can be modeled with a normal distribution. The mean distance would be based on typical sidewalk widths and locations relative to intersections, which is between 8 to 12 feet.

      FINAL_ANSWER:
      SPEED_DISTRIBUTION = Normal(30, 5) # 30 mph with std 5 mph
      EVASIVE_MANEUVERS_DISTRIBUTION = Uniform(["emergency braking", "swerve to the left", "swerve to the right"])
      PROXIMITY_TO_IMPACT_DISTRIBUTION = Range(1, 6) # Between 1 foot and 6 feet
      ACTIONS_TAKEN_DISTRIBUTION = Uniform(["braking", "changing direction", "accelerating"])
      PEDESTRIAN_DISTANCE_DISTRIBUTION = Normal(10, 2) # Mean distance of 10 feet with std 2 feet

              # If straight route is not available, then any available turn route will be taken, uniformly randomly. 
              # If turning at the intersection, the vehicle will slow down to make the turn, safely.

              # :param laneToFollow: If the lane to follow is different from the lane that the vehicle is on, this parameter can be used to specify that lane. By default, this variable will be set to None, which means that the vehicle will follow the lane that it is currently on.
          behavior FollowTrajectoryBehavior(target_speed : float = 10, trajectory : List[Lane] = None, turn_speed : float = None):
              # Follows the given trajectory. The behavior terminates once the end of the trajectory is reached.

      Scenic is a probabilistic programming language for modeling the environments of autonomous cars. A Scenic program defines a distribution over scenes, configurations of physical objects and agents. Scenic can also define (probabilistic) policies for dynamic agents, allowing modeling scenarios where agents take actions over time in response to the state of the world. We use CARLA to render the scenes and simulate the agents.

      Your task is to write the first part of a Scenic program, the declaration section. This section defines, objects, agents, and distributions that are used in the program. Here are a few examples:
