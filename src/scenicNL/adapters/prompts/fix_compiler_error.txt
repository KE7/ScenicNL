I previously asked you to write me a Scenic program but your program faced a compiler error. Here is the error message:
{compiler_error}

Here is your program:
{scenic_program}

Do not make a conversation or respond with anything else except the following:
# <your step-by-step reasoning of how to fix the program as lines of Python comments>
<your fixed scenic program>
