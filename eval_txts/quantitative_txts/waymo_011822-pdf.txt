On January 18, 2022 at 5:20 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle on 14th Street at S. Van Ness Avenue.

The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode on eastbound 14th Street as it approached S. Van Ness Avenue. The test driver (in the driver’s
seating position) transitioned to manual mode before reaching the intersection. The Waymo AV then proceeded through a green light into
the intersection in manual mode. A passenger vehicle traveling northbound on S. Van Ness Avenue then entered the intersection against its
red light, making contact with the front of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a

test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage to its front fascia and the passenger vehicle
sustained damage to its driver side doors.
