A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling southwest bound on Mission Street between Ist
and 2nd Streets when the Cruise AV slowed down. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter,

another vehicle made contact with the right rear corner of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s right rear bumper, fender, and hatch.
There were no injuries and police were not called.
