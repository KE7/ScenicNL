A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“AV”), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light on
eastbound 26th Street at the intersection with Mission Street. As the AV was proceeding after the light turned green, a Dodge Charger
traveling southbound on Mission Street failed to stop for the red light, entered the intersection, and made contact with the AV, damaging the
front and rear driver side and rear bumper fascia of the AV. Police and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were called to the scene. The

AV was towed from the scene. The passenger of the Dodge Charger was assessed by medical personnel at the scene and was not transported
by EMS.
