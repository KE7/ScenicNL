A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in driverless autonomous mode, was traveling westbound on 19th Street between
Capp Street and Mission Street. The Cruise AV slowed to a stop due to a pedestrian on a scooter who entered the lane of traffic in front of
the AV and started proceeding in circles. Shortly thereafter, the pedestrian approached the stopped Cruise AV, placed the scooter on the
ground in front of the Cruise AVâ€™s front passenger side tire, and walked away off the roadway. After the pedestrian left, the Cruise AV

attempted to proceed forward and made contact with the abandoned scooter. There were no damages to the Cruise AV and there were no
reported injuries.
