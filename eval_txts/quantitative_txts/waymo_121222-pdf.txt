On December 12, 2022 at 4:54 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving an SUV on Monterey Boulevard at Circular Avenue.

The Waymo AV was stopped facing east on Monterey Boulevard behind stopped traffic in the left-most through lane in autonomous mode.
An SUV approached from behind and attempted to change lanes into the left turn lane, making contact with the left rear sensor of the

Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in
the driver’s seating position). Both vehicles sustained damage.
