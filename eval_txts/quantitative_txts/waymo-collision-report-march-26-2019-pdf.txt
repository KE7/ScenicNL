A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was traveling in manual mode when it was involved in a collision at the intersection of E.
Charleston Road and San Antonio Road in Palo Alto. The Waymo AV was traveling eastbound on E. Charleston Road in manual mode
when the test driver made a lane change from the middle lane to the adjacent right lane. As the test driver completed the lane change, the
test driver braked before the intersection as the traffic light at San Antonio Road changed from yellow to red. A passenger vehicle then
rear-ended the Waymo AV at approximately 15 MPH. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to the passenger side of the rear bumper,
and the passenger vehicle sustained minor damage to the driver side of the front bumper. No injuries were reported at the scene.
