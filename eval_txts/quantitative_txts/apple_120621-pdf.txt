A test vehicle operating in manual mode was traveling Southeast on El Camino Real in Sunnyvale, and had just crossed Fair Oaks Avenue
when a white Lexus RX 350 vehicle pulled out of a parking lot without yielding to oncoming traffic. The driver of the test vehicle braked

but was unable to stop before making contact with the front driverâ€™s side of the Lexus. No injuries were reported and law enforcement was
not called to the scene.
