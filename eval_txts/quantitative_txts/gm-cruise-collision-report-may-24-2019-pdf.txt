A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was changing lanes into the left turn lane on eastbound Geary
Boulevard between 8th and 9th Avenues when the Cruise AV slowed down. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous

mode and, shortly thereafter, another vehicle changing into the same lane made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV, damaging
the Cruise AV’s bumper. There were no injuries and police were not called.
