A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was making a left turn onto eastbound Duboce Avenue from
southbound Castro Street when the Cruise AV yielded to an oncoming car. The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode
and, shortly thereafter, another vehicle made contact with the rear bumper of the Cruise AV. There were no injuries reported at the scene by
either party and police were not called. Both of the Cruise AV test operators later mentioned neck and back pain.
