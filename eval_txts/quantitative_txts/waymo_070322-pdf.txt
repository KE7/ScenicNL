On July 3, 2022 at 2:18 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger car on 19th Street at Valencia Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling west on 19th Street and preparing to make a left turn onto Valencia street to travel south. A passenger car
passed the Waymo AV and the vehicle directly behind the Waymo AV by crossing into and driving in the opposing lane of traffic. As the
passenger vehicle passed the Waymo on the left, the right side of the passenger vehicle made contact with the front left corner of the
Waymo AV, immediately after which the passenger car left the scene. At the time of impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not
engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage.
