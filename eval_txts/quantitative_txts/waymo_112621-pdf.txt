On November 26, 2021 at 8:02 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a passenger vehicle at Scotia Avenue, Thornton Avenue, and Bridgeview Drive.

The Waymo AV was traveling southbound on Scotia Avenue, a narrow road with vehicles parked on both sides, and approaching the
intersection with Thornton Avenue and Bridgeview Drive. A passenger vehicle approaching from the right of the Waymo AV on eastbound
Thornton Avenue made a left turn in front of the Waymo AV to head northbound on Scotia Avenue. The Waymo AV slowed to a near stop
and nudged to its right in order to share the narrow road with the oncoming vehicle and then came to a stop at the stop sign as the oncoming
vehicle completed its turn. At approximately 5 mph, the turning passenger vehicle made contact with Waymo AV’s sensor hardware
housing on the driver side rear corner fender of the stopped Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was
engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV sustained minor damage to
