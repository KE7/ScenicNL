A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in autonomous mode, was traveling northbound on Leavenworth Street between
Geary and Post Streets when another vehicle changed from the right adjacent lane to ahead of the Cruise AV without using its left signal.
The driver of the Cruise AV disengaged from autonomous mode and, shortly thereafter, a second vehicle made contact with the rear bumper
of the Cruise AV, damaging the Cruise AV’s rear bumper mounting bracket. Police were not called and no injuries were reported at the
scene by either party. The Cruise AV tester sitting in the driver’s seat later mentioned neck pain.
