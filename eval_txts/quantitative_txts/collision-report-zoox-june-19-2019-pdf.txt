A Zoox vehicle, operating in manual mode, was traveling southbound on Mason Street at less than 3mph when a cyclist, traveling
westbound on Sutter Street at a red light, cycled into the rear end of the Zoox vehicle.

The incident occurred when the Zoox vehicle proceeded toward the intersection of Mason and Sutter, the cyclist entered Mason Street
against the one-way onto the crosswalk to pass behind the Zoox vehicle. The cyclist then clipped the left rear side of the Zoox vehicle. After
contact, the cyclist did not stop to exchange information and continued traveling westbound on Sutter Street.
