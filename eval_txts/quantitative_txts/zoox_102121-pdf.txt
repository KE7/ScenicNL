While in manual mode, the Zoox vehicle was proceeding straight on Columbus St. through the intersection at Mason, when a pickup truck
in the left adjacent lane turned right in front of the Zoox vehicle. The truck contacted the Zoox vehicle which incurred minor damage to its
front left bumper. There were no injuries and the police were not called.
