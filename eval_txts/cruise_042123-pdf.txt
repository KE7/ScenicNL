A Cruise autonomous vehicle ("Cruise AV"), operating in manual mode, was at a complete stop in response to a red light in the rightmost
lane on westbound Geary Boulevard at the intersection with Larkin Street. While the Cruise AV was fully stopped, a Mercedes SUV exited
a parking lot onto westbound Geary Boulevard, pulled behind and to the left of the Cruise AV, and made contact with the left side of the
Cruise AV, causing damage to the Cruise AVâ€™s rear driver side door and rear driver side wheel well. The parties exchanged information.
The Cruise AV operator in the Cruise AV later reported head, shoulder and back injuries.
