On April 13, 2022 at 2:53 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a pickup truck on Bayshore Boulevard at Jerrold Avenue.

The Waymo AV was traveling in autonomous mode in the slip lane on northbound Jerrold Avenue at Bayshore Boulevard. As the Waymo
AV slowed to yield to a pedestrian pushing a shopping cart in a crosswalk, the Waymo AV test driver transitioned to manual mode and
stopped the Waymo AV. The Waymo AV test driver then proceeded forward but had to yield to approaching traffic in the merge between
northbound Jerrold Avenue and northbound Bayshore Boulevard. As the Waymo AV came to a stop, a pickup truck traveling behind the

Waymo AV then made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged
and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both vehicles sustained minor damage.
