On August 31,2021 at 7:30 AM PDT, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving another vehicle near the intersection of 25th Street at York Street. The Waymo AV was stopped near the end of the 2500
block of 25th Street after having executed a pull-over in autonomous mode, at which time the operator of the Waymo AV took manual
control of the Waymo AV and proceeded into the driving lane. The Waymo AV then made contact with the right rear fender of a passenger
vehicle passing the Waymo AV on the left side. Both vehicles incurred minor damage.
