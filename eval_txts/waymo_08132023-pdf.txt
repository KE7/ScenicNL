On August 13, 2023 at 9:01 PM a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
involving a passenger car on Howard Street at Fourth Street.

The Waymo AV was traveling southwestbound on Howard Street in the second lane from the left as it was approaching Fourth Street. As
the Waymo AV was proceeding straight through the intersection, the passenger car in the right adjacent lane made a left turn from a
straight-only lane onto southeastbound Fourth Street. The rear of the passenger car made contact with the front of the Waymo AV. At the

time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. Both
the Waymo AV and the passenger car sustained damage.
