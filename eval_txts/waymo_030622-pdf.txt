On March 6, 2022 at 6:00 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision
on Oak Street at Divisadero Street.

The Waymo AV was parked in manual mode on the right side of Oak Street just east of Divisadero Street. The Waymo AV inched forward
and to the left momentarily, but stopped as two cyclists approached the rear of the vehicle. As the second of the two cyclists attempted to
pass the Waymo AV, they made contact with the left rear view mirror. The cyclist stopped momentarily but then rode away without
exchanging information. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver was operating the
Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor damage. No injuries were reported.
