On January 22, 2022 at 2:11 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, CA was in a collision
involving a motorcycle on Folsom Street at 23rd Street.

The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode on southbound Folsom Street in the intersection with 23rd Street, when the Waymo AV began to
slow for a motorcyclist traveling on northbound Folsom Street signaling to make an unprotected left turn onto 23rd Street. The test driver
(in the driver’s seating position) transitioned to manual mode and continued to slow the Waymo AV. The motorcyclist attempted to turn
behind the Waymo AV and made contact with the left rear corner of the Waymo AV. The motorcyclist remained upright and rode away
without stopping to provide any information. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver
was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage to the driver’s side of the rear bumper.
