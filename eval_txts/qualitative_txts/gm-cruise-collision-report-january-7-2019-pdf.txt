A Cruise autonomous vehicle (“Cruise AV”), operating in conventional mode, was making a left turn from northeast bound Folsom Street
onto northwest bound 11th Street when a scooterist, attempting to pass the Cruise AV on the left, made contact with the front left side of the
Cruise AV, damaging the front left fender, radar, and wheel well of the Cruise AV. The scooterist reported injuries and emergency services

and the police arrived at the scene, but the scooterist declined medical treatment. No police report was available at the time of the filing of
this report.
