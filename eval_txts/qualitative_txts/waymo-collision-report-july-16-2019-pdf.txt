A Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) was stopped in manual mode on southbound Central Expressway approaching Thompson
Avenue in Mountain View when it was rear-ended. The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic when a passenger vehicle made contact with a
sensor on the Waymo AV’s rear bumper at approximately less than 1 MPH. The Waymo AV’s sensor sustained minor damage, and the
passenger vehicle left the scene without exchanging information. There were no injuries reported at the scene.
