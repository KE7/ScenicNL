On November 6, 2021 at 4:28 PM PDT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger vehicle on Powell Street at Pacific Avenue.

The Waymo AV was traveling in autonomous mode southbound on Powell Street when it activated its right turn signal and prepared to
make a right turn onto Pacific Avenue. The Waymo AV stopped to yield to a pedestrian who was in the adjacent crosswalk on Pacific
Avenue. A passenger vehicle behind the Waymo AV made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo
AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s seating position). The Waymo AV
sustained minor damage to its rear bumper, and the trailing passenger vehicle sustained minor damage to its front bumper.
