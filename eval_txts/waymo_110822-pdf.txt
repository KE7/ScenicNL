On November 8, 2022 at 9:34 AM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (“Waymo AV”) operating in San Francisco, California was in a
collision involving a passenger car on 2nd Street at Minna Street.

The Waymo AV was stopped in traffic on northbound 2nd Street in autonomous mode. A passenger car that had been stopped behind the

Waymo AV passed on the left side, crossing the double yellow line and making contact with the Waymo AV’s rear left sensor housing. The
passenger car immediately left the scene.

At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV’s Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver’s
seating position). The Waymo AV sustained damage.
