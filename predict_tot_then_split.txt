 Here is the relevant information for writing part of a Scenic Program for this scenario:

The key behaviors include FollowLaneBehavior, LaneChangeBehavior, AccelerateForwardBehavior, ConstantThrottleBehavior, and DriveAvoidingCollisions. The best matching map would be Town03 as it mentions features like Sacramento Street having intersections. The vehicles that most closely match are a Tesla Model 3 for the Cruise AV since it is described as autonomous, and a Honda Accord for the vehicle explicitly mentioned in the description. Details around missing values like vehicle speeds and locations are reasonable to represent with probability distributions like TruncatedNormal and Discrete ranges based on the information provided.

 Here are key details for writing part of a Scenic Program to simulate this scene:

The program should include a Cruise AV traveling westbound in the left lane on Sacramento Street and a Honda Accord initially behind it in the right lane. The Honda Accord should accelerate and change lanes into the parking lane to the left of the AV in an attempt to pass. It should then begin to merge back into the AV's lane. 

Relevant behaviors include FollowLaneBehavior, LaneChangeBehavior, AccelerateForwardBehavior, and DriveAvoidingCollisions. Maps like Town03 downtown area could provide a suitable environment with multilane roads and intersections matching the description. Vehicles like a Tesla Model 3 and Honda Accord are reasonable matches to the autonomous vehicle and Accord described.

 Here is the Scenic program code relevant to recreating the scene:

add_vehicle(tesla_model_3, "CruiseAV")
add_vehicle(honda_accord, "Honda") 

follow_lane("CruiseAV", left_lane)
follow_lane("Honda", right_lane)

constant_throttle("CruiseAV", 35) 
accelerate_forward("Honda")

lane_change("Honda", parking_lane)
lane_change("Honda", left_lane) 

drive_avoiding_collisions

set_map(town03)

This code defines the key vehicles, sets their initial lanes and behaviors, and selects the most suitable map to recreate the scene described in the prompt.

 Here are the key behaviors and maps relevant for writing part of a Scenic Program to simulate this traffic scenario:

The key behaviors include FollowLaneBehavior, LaneChangeBehavior, AccelerateForwardBehavior, ConstantThrottleBehavior, and DriveAvoidingCollisions. The best map match would be Town03, as it features streets like Sacramento Street that have intersections. The vehicles that most closely match are a Tesla Model 3 for the Cruise AV since it is described as autonomous, and a Honda Accord for the vehicle explicitly mentioned in the description.

 Here are the key behaviors and maps from the expert discussion that would be most relevant for writing part of a Scenic Program for this scenario:

The relevant behaviors are FollowLaneBehavior, LaneChangeBehavior, AccelerateForwardBehavior, ConstantThrottleBehavior, and DriveAvoidingCollisions. The maps that could be used are Town03 or Town05, but Town03 is likely the best match as it may contain features like intersections mentioned in the scenario taking place on Sacramento Street. The vehicles that most closely match are a Tesla Model 3 for the Cruise AV since it is described as autonomous, and a Honda Accord for the vehicle explicitly mentioned in the description.
